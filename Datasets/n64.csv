1,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,10,"I won't bore you with what everyone is already saying about how amazing this game is.  But if you're on the fence about whether to give this classic a try, go read IGN's review.",Kaistlin
2,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,10,"Anyone who gives the masterpiece below a 7 or an 8 is either just here to hate on the astounding zelda franchise, doesn't know a DAMN good game or is insane.

The dungeons are interesting and unique, the characters are interesting and have personality, the story is highly engaging, the combat is varied, fluid, and fun, the items are amazing, there are a plethora of interesting side quests and collectibles, and considering the fact that this game was made in 1998 the graphics are amazing. The only real downside is that the game is somewhat linear and you can't continue on after beating the final boss, but that doesn't detract from the huge amount of fun I had playing this game. This has to be one of if not the best games ever made just as the others have said.",Jacody
3,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,10,"I'm one of those people who think that this is the greatest game of all time, no matter what quality games are out now or will be out ever.

All I hadI'm one of those people who think that this is the greatest game of all time, no matter what quality games are out now or will be out ever. This is just plain the best game I've ever played. Why? Partly because it was the first good game I've actually played. When I first got a Nintendo 64 I was considerably young, and yet every game I played I thought was absolutely horrible. All I had were simple objective games, and as a child I thought they were hard and pointless. Then one day Ocarina of Time was brought home and I at first refused to play it. So I watched my father play it for a while, and straight away it was something entirely new and different. Also at the time, it was the most real (to me at least). What brought me in was the ability to actually explore and get to know people, even if the people you talked to all repeated the same things over and over no matter how many times you talked to them, but it didn't matter. This game was something new and exciting to me, and to this day I get this good old nostalgic feeling whenever I play it. It has one of the greatest stories of all time for a video game and was one of the first to create its own sort of universe and it was one of the first 3D environment game where you can see in all 360 degrees (after Mario 64 that is). Plus to this day people are still discovering new secrets to the game and so many in-depth theories arise from this title alone based upon this game that keep it interesting. The characters feel like characters and the visuals are some of the most cinematic of its time. The gameplay is also very fun, which of course is one of the most important things and there are very involving puzzles that are simple enough in appears but very complex when you get down to it. There is so much that I could say about this game, but sometimes even looking back, I'm at a loss of words at how awesome this game is.",doodlerman

7,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,10,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is without a doubt one of the greatest video games of all time. To say that this game was great is an understatement. Ocarina introduced the gaming world to the aspect of open world play with a wonderfully sized map that was large and full of exploration but not in the slightest bit unnecessary. The level and dungeon design was the best of it's time andThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is without a doubt one of the greatest video games of all time. To say that this game was great is an understatement. Ocarina introduced the gaming world to the aspect of open world play with a wonderfully sized map that was large and full of exploration but not in the slightest bit unnecessary. The level and dungeon design was the best of it's time and in still to this day remains one of most brilliant, beautiful, and interesting worlds of any video game on the market. Every area you explore from the moment you wake up in the lush and green forest of the Kokiri to the vast and deep desert of the Gerudos' is crafted to perfection. The combat system in Ocarina was also a shining star. Not only did weapons feel right, react well, and play out perfectly, but they were always interesting and had their own advantages. Not once did a weapon outshine another because they all had a great purpose. The Z-Targeting system was added for a more cinematic feel that worked flawlessly and it even made combat easier and more interesting. The music and sounds of the game brought it to life as well. Every area had it's own theme music that was unique to that zone and always felt right and gave the player that more personal feeling wherever he/she went. Kokiri Forest felt like a wonderful place of happiness while Hyrule Field had an epic and powerful tone to it. The addition of musical gameplay made things more interesting as well and showed an importance to every area the player visited. Now, most importantly to the Zelda series itself and to any video game for that matter, comes the story. The Legend of Zelda has always been a series shining in the glory of it's adventures and this was the biggest and most powerful of them all. You begin as a young boy who has always felt left out and who has nightmares of dark visions that would become realities. As you start your quest you realize your true destiny and embark on a journey filled with adventure and courage like no other. The dark king of the Gerudo's Gannondorf seeks the legendary Triforce and will stop at nothing to rule the land of Hyrule. By unleashing monsters from the Temples' of Hyrule and by turning the once good and just land to pure evil, Gannondorf attempts total rule over the world. Link being the Hero of Hyrule must journey to the different lands and temples' of the land in order to gain power from the mystical ""sages"" and stop Gannondorf. The story in Ocarina beings great and never lets go. In fact the game gets better every second that it progresses. You meet many interesting characters such as Princess Ruto, Malon, Darunia, and the mysterious Sheik that not only have their own individual traits, but also contain important roles in your quest. Also, each character is easily remembered and full of emotion which grasps the player and gives them a sense of caring and passion for each one. The many temples and dungeons visited during the game are all fun, unique, and interesting and reward the player as he/she progresses. The game has quite a few side quests that are entertaining and it follows through right up to the end. There is nothing negative about this game and to this day it stands on a pedestal as one of if not the greatest game of all time and for good reason. Since it's release very few games have captured the true story, art, and power Ocarina of Time had mastered back in 1998. To this day I myself still play it and still consider it my favorite game ever. Not because of great graphics, or online play, or anything else that current games have fallen into but because Zelda is a game that touched my heart like no other game ever has. Current game developers and enthusiasts need to look back at The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and reconsider the direction that games are going. Zelda mastered it, and for that we should honor it.",pittsburghboy91
8,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This game is do doubt the greatest game in existance. Non, except for Nintendo haters, have been able to play this game without admiting it is at least one of the best of the best, if not THE best of the best. Super Mario 64 was the first game to make 3D conversion work, but this was the game that perfected it. It introduced a large 3 dimensional world to explore, which at the time was a huge deal. It also introduced new gameplay mechanics that made the action adventure genre work out even more. Like the lock-on targeting system, which helped to keep your eye on the enemy much easier, but without making the fighting too easy, as you had to meneuver around the enemy and dodge his attacks. Another big new feature was horse-back riding. Riding your horse around the huge field was big and new. It had an engaging story, that really sucked you in, which had lots of twists and turns. Like when Ganondorf attacked the castle, destroying your plan to get the Triforce before Ganon did. Or near the end, when Shiek, the man who helped you on your journey as an adult, reveals himself to be Princess Zelda, the person Link had been searching long and hard for. Another thing was the conversion from Young Link to Adult Link. This was the first Zelda game that introduced Adult Link, making him look more epic, and more like the hero of the legends. But the bigger twist is how you can play as both Young Link and Adult Link. Not only that, but the story counts on you using both of them to make it all the way through the story. There are alot of complicated dungeons with puzzles to solve, which can sometime twist your brain, and make the game much more challenging. What I loved about Zelda was the flawless gameplay and beautiful landscapes. Zelda Ocarina of Time was a first, it brought forth the perfection of 3D conversion, and made it beautiful, but also made the 3D mechanics work with how the game played out, and it worked beautifully. Of course the game isn't perfect, there are a few flaws in Ocarina of Time. Like the Water Temple, which is the most unpopular dungeon in the game. Everyone had a hard time with it, so it proved to be a bit too challenging. Plus in some parts of the game, the graphics don't look good at all. However, these flaws are not severe enough to interfere with the games overall greatness. There may be no such thing as a perfect game, but this game is as close to a perfect game as you can get. Zelda Ocarina of Time won Game of the Year in 1998, and got an honorable award in outstanding gaming achievement in 1999, and it didn't win these awards without good reason. This game is truley the best game of all time, and anyone who thinks they can make a game better than this is absolutely crazy. Sure Ocarina of Time may not be outstanding by todays standards, but considering the technology of gaming at the time, it was the best gaming could offer. Even 13 years after the game came out, Ocarina of Time is still selling like nuts via the Wii Virtual Console, which re-released Ocarina of Time in 2007. In my opinion, Ocarina of Time is, and will always be, the greatest game ever made, and I'm not alone in that statement. I have yet to meet a person who is not a Zelda hater who played Ocarina of Time and thought the games was horrible. Ocarina of Time is the best of the best in gaming, hands down, and it deserves a perfect score more than any game.",Nosidda89

10,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,10,"Essentially one of the best games of all time, no cheese. Pros: Beautiful graphics for the N64; subtle, but challenging gameplay; variety of dungeons, puzzles, and secrets; innovative and imaginative.

It's a bit identical to A Link to the Past on the SNES, but with 3D rendered visuals and there is a lack of personality within many characters compared to the later Zelda games where character personalities has improved in.

If you're wondering how big this game is, it's around 256 megabits. It still is amazing. If you wanted to compress that large of a game, with the music, dungeons, all of the sidequests, the main storyline, and everything else in that small space, you get this game. It's incredible they fit it into that size. Of course, the game still has it's downsides, but minor, as that the major complaint is the storyline. You can see beyond the storyline that it's still the ""save the princess"" scenario, but I found myself lost when I was exploring that game.",totlmstr

Without a doubt, the back story, plot and setting of the whole game is definitely well made to fit with the story of Hyrule, and the legend that is the Legend Of Zelda series that started on the NES. The battles and triumphs and the twist that splits the series in two, none of it would be possible without Shigeru Myamoto's brilliant mind and logic. The game flourishes in a brilliant Open-world setting, as we gamers agree, the best type of game there is (Grand Theft Auto and LA Noire are examples of Open World Games). Brilliant gameplay, especially being the first 3D Zelda game in which all others based off of, and I think people can have continuous fun hours on end just messing around with the Ocarina lol.",RazorEye

This game is THE blueprint, not on for Zelda games but any Zelda-inspired game since. The reasons this game is cited as ""The Best Game of All Time"" are many, all of which are accurate. It was really the first game evr to break through what is known as the ""polygon ceiling"". Franchises just couldn't make the jump to 3D correctly, either failing miserably like Bubsy or having to sacrifice something to make the grade meaning those games lost exactly what made the series good (Castlevania is the one that springs to mind here). OoT, however, not only showed everyone how 3D should be done, but how games should be done in general by having a great, fun story with plenty of twists and turns along the way, great controls that were simple to pick up and play and a massive amount of innovations with Z-Targeting being the most prevalent. Enjoyiing that lock-on in any game ever? You have Ocarina to thank for that. The puzzles were brilliant because they showcased the 3D perfectly, making you have to utilise spacial awareness by, for example, standing at a vantage point to fire an arrow through a lit torch so it sets on fire and ignites an extinguished torch at the other end of the room. No 3D game did that, which is why it was the pinnacle of the new revolution. The game is enormous even today, with in-depth side-quests that can easily detract you from the story for hours. Puzzles aren't out of reach for anyone so you don't have to be a genius to carry on with the story. Yes, sometimes the puzzles are more of the same, but that is really all they could do at the time with technology and memory constraints. This game was so big, a GamePak with increased memory was made just for this game, that later on became the standard memory allowance. The music is instantly recognisable and most of the well-known Zelda tracks are from this game, the only main song missing is the Zelda theme at the start instead opting for original music which, while an excellent piece is a little disappointing. Even after a decade, it's still the highest scored game ever on this site and there is a reason for that. This is not just a great Zelda game, but the greatest game of all time.

Dungeon and level design is top notch and so clever they can be learned from even now. So much excellent extra content in exploring, secrets, mini-games and collectables that actually matter and improve your character and enhance the gameplay and is fun to do. Combat has alot of puzzle elements imbedded as well, especially the bosses require finding a solution whilst in the heat of the battle.

I was sneaking around a large Military base in my favourite series  ""Metal Gear Solid"" and capping zombies left, right and center in ""Resident Evil 2"", whilst happily stopping Gruntilda in ""Banjo Kazooie"" and getting lost in paintings in the superb ""Super Mario 64"".As soon as you load up this Game, The Introduction will NEVER leave your memory, Koji Kondo's Introductory music will attach itself to your brain and along with the cinematic of a young adult riding his horse through the vast Hyrule field sums up everything you need to know that this is going to be quite the Adventure.The story involves a young boy living in the woods with other equally aged kids, who is summoned by the  forest deity ""The Great Deku Tree"" who sends the boy named ""Link"" and his new Companion ""Navi"" the fairy on a Journey to save the Land of Hyrule and it's Princess ""Zelda"" from the Evil tyrant ""Ganondorf"".And from there on an Epic tale that spans several years begins, interacting with the many citizens and species of the lands, revisiting them years later to see how their domains have stood the test of time, and of course dungeons and puzzles all expertly crafted around fantastic tools you'll discover and ultimately need to take down some of gaming's most memorable foes.Again just writing this down you KNOW this game is Legend, obviously take note that I had not played the superb games in the series beforehand, and this was my introduction to superbly crafted 3-D gaming space suddenly do you realize just how much Ocarina of Time, has raised the bar, set the standard and still to this day is the pinnacle of Adventure Gaming.I have to say that I never really had problems with the controls (I heard many people found them clustered), I will admit, I tend to rate things on how well they will stand the test of time, On an unrelated topic ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is my favourite movie as I've seen it countless times and never tire or find boredom in any part of it's running time, that's also this game, not once do I have any bitterness towards any part, I guess on repeated playthroughs did I realize that I couldn't wait to play the 2nd Act of this game where the abundance of development really soaks in.Receiving more Items, Learning Ocarina melodies, Dungeon and Cave exploration (I really find myself wanting to play it again right now). It remains just as relevant now as it did 15 years ago...Final Verdict: I better end here because in all honesty I could go on forever, it needs to be played to be believed, and I hope anyone reading this ""got"" how much this game means the way I felt about it years ago and even today.

And anyone saying that ""people votingFirstly, allow me to state an absolute that I'll probably get downvoted to Oblivion for pointing out: This game is, in a very obvious sense, overrated. This, however, has no correlation with its quality; I simply mean to make the fact apparent that some 10/10 reviews, well, shouldn't be as inflated as they are despite the amazing quality of this game. And anyone saying that ""people voting 8's or 7's are idiots"" are really nothing more than just stubborn giga-fans. That being said, my critique is as follows:There's no denial that this game is a great experience for apt Zelda fans. It presents a wonderful, new environment to the player, an arguably mega-fluid combat system, a light, yet invest-worthy engine, and most of all, a mood-setter that can be matched by few other games. Immersion is in near totality, with its only shortcomings being the limitations of the time. There's little that can be said against the game.However, there is in fact, even in this masterpiece, room for some error:The main problem in the game, though not overwhelmingly prominent, is the slight feeling of emptiness associated with plot-carrying. If you choose to look at it standalone, there is a present problem in the fact that the game never truly reaches the point that you feel the overwhelming need to ""push on"" towards the end-result (which I'll not spoil). You feel, rather than working with Link to reach a goal, that you're watching the story play out for you. The problem with deciding the factoring of this error into a numeric review is the fact that the fault of this is halfway between the creators themselves, but also the simple limitations of the time. The only thing that's stopping me from giving this a full 10/10 is the likely possibility that this error could have been fixed, or at least improved with more consideration into immersion, no matter the era. And to be fair, a 10/10 implies a perfect game. Meaning there would be NO POSSIBILITY for ANY improvement in the game, which this game barely falls short of.There's not much more to say. This is, arguably, one of the greatest games ever made, and is near-perfect aside from it's minor immersion flaw. But I'd recommend this game to anyone in a heartbeat. The environment, the gameplay, the whole feeling of it is just about as close to near-flawless as a game could be at that era.",NinjaBucket

Ok so first of all people who gave this a game a 0 don't deserve to rate games. A game that is a 0 dosent work. 1 is a game where everything is so bad and its barley and game etc. This game came out in 98 and set the bar so high few games still have managed to hit that bar. When this game came out in 98 people where mind blown. It was one of the games in history that changed gaming. This game has aged well, Many people who are new gamers who are used to graphics and dramatic scenes may not like it as much because its old but will still enjoy it so much. This game has great music, characters, terrain, and probably the best development of any video game. Link the hero of time starts off as a lazy kid who is rejected by everybody in the kokiri village. He dosent even have his own fairy. But as you progress through the story Link keeps getting stronger and stronger just enough to beat the next boss. Towards the mid point of the game where you get the ocarina of time Link finally meets ganandorf. Link With great courage draws his sword and weapon but is easily knocked off by ganandorf. Ganandorf then laughs and leaves in pursuit of the princess. Link has gotten strong but not nearly strong enough. The sages knew link could not take on ganon at this age so they put link into a deep 7 year sleep. Now Link (matured) has been informed what has happend to hyrule and now he must find all the sages in order to beat ganon and save hyrule. So link sets off running around hyrule, temple to temple gaining even more strength and weapons. In the end Link is now strong enough to face the evil lord in a epic showdown between shadow vs light, the hero of time who possesses the triforce of courage vs the evil demon king who possesses the triforce of power. After a long epic struggle Link the hero of time prevails and defeats Ganon stabbing him with the master sword in the head. Link went from the the lazy boy without a fairy to a Legend who saved hyrule from complete destruction.",Brendon6446

Obviously you shouldn't listen to the haters who give this game 0... but you shouldn't listen to the fans either. I'll give this game the fairest review that i can.Pros:-Breathtaking graphics, even though they couldn't match up to Horizon, the scenery is way more animated style instead of real life style, witch kinda gives off a better vibe. And for all those who say""ok"" graphics, it's probably because you play PS4 and can't appreciate nintendo graphics-great music. Lots of games""Like minecraft Pocket edition"" who are based in open world experience forget the music, witch gives a sense of loneliness in the open world. This game has a soundtrack for every single place or time. And they're all great.-Stuff to do. A lot of people""like me""made the horrible decision to look up every single shrine, side quest, korok seed and locations and spoiled the entire game. I saw one of the reviews saying that""Oh it feels like you're just aimlessly walking around hyrule untile you get board""Thats because you don't bother looking for things to do! If you can't find anything, you're blind, cuz there are tons of hidden secrets, side quests, murderers that awiat you! If you don't bother even checking for stuff to do and just aimlessly walk on rocks all day, that's your fault! I found myself taking on enemy camps in the middle of an ocean!I could name a ton of other things that make this game great, but that will take ages....Cons:-Small frame rate issues: This may happen 1 to 3 times per cession when the game is overloaded with action, but nothing major-Ending: This is what i despise the most of this game, the ending! You'd think that this ending a 10/10 ign game would have a great ending....wrong, just wrong.The most bland, unthought part of the entire game. First, the boss!?! What in the hell were the creators thinking! I won't spoil, but the final boss is even easier then the sub bosses.Then we have the shortest unfinished cutscene! To make matters worse, the game resets to where you face ganon, like nothing changed. The main quest to destroy ganon is still incomplete, the only difference...a tiny star to remind you that you beat him....wtf. Other then that, nothing changed. The castle is still red evil, at least we could have had a regular castle not in golfed with guardians, but nope! You gotta deal with this stupid castle still filled with enemies and an incomplete story.-Save files: 1 save file for the entire game... Wanna start a new adventure, gonna have to erase your old story...sorry-Weapon variety: Ok so there are a lot of weapons in this game, but when you think about it, they're all the same, only devised in 3 categories: swords, spears, and heavies. These three categories of weapons all have a different move sets, but the initial weapons are exactly the same, sometimes with a few changes. Example: The master sword is the exact same as the royal sword, just with different looks, power and ability, they don't have somewhat like a different move pool. Makes things boringThat's about it for what i really have to hate about the game, otherwise it's great!Should you buy a switch for this game: if you are someone that likes action like cod, then don't. If you complain about 4K graphics or are way too picky with every single detail, don't buy it. If you hate nintendo and wish you had all of their money, don't buy it. If you're too lazy to search a huge 10000mile wide world, don't buy itIn any other case, buy it! A fantastic game that should be enjoyed by everywone. Don't listen to the haters that give this game 0/10 or 5/10 and say that this game is horrible because of this or that. Just be aware of what you should look out for.",Hill456

I went ahead and played through both Majora's Mask and Wind Waker, each notable, deserving, and great in its own right. But neither, nor any game before or since, has matched what Miyamoto delivered (including Miyamoto himself) in terms of sheer gaming experience. Sure, one can argue the graphics today are better, the sound crisper, the controls snappier. But make no mistake about it. This is the Citizen Kane -- or Casablanca, Godfather, GWTW if you prefer -- of the gaming industry. A feat accomplished once in a lifetime.

231,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I'm usually against overrated games, but this game is deservedly so. The game starts out like a cheesy kids' game, and seems innocent enough. Then, a third of the way through, link gets imprisoned in a deep sleep for 7 years. The awakening is one of the most powerful things I've experienced in a game. You leave the building you slept in, and you immediately notice a darker tone to the area than when you entered. A red ring hovers over a previously dormant volcano ominously, signifying its turning active. The castle town, once thriving and bustling, now has its buildings charred and undead (the enemy's name is called redead) walk the streets. The castle itself, once peaceful, is replaced by a dark and sinister tower hovering over a pool of lava.There are many more reasons why everyone should play this game obviously, but that is my favorite moment in the game, and even the series. The other games are great too, but they don't quite live up to this.",jaga420

The weapons and items are varied and unusual. There was side missions to keep the adventure fun and moving. The temples and bosses were well thought out. The warp songs are convenient, but hard to memorize. Time travel on top of all that made it a great quest. One of my friends said it perfectly when they said, ""Can you think of a better game at the time?"" My answer was ""No, good point."" There are a few problems I had with it though. The game kept abruptly stopping due to major perplexity and frustration, which stems from a lack of explanation or some subtle detail that was understandably overlooked. The game required the Internet more times than it required the ocarina. The beginning was mundane and underwhelming, but that was understandable because it was basically a tutorial so it was only irritating while you were playing it. Also, the water temple is agreed by most to be lengthy, repetitive, discreet, drawn-out, and questionable why the iron boots must be taken on and off an endless amount of times. At least, they fixed that in the remake for the Nintendo 3DS. Also, the fairy won't shut up through the entire game. She, or he, or whatever, wasn't helpful and kept interrupting gameplay for obvious info about the game. The only time I got peace and quiet is when I fought Ganondorf or when I shut the system off. I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares about it. My favorite temple was the forest temple and the shadow temple. Both creative and large, much like the game. I mentioned all the game's flaws, and not a lot of its strong points. I don't mean to say the game is bad, hence the 8 I gave it.

I've just finished Ocarina of Time (100% I might add) for the first time ever. It's a great game! However, there are a few flaws. Thankfully, those flaws don't mean you shouldn't pick the game up right now and play it! First of all, the shops. They serve absolutely no purpose. I have gotten through the whole game without ever buying anything unnecessary from the shops. I did need healing and magic, though, but you always have a fairy ready somewhere to trap in a jar, so that's the only heal you'll ever need. And you're always full on magic, except the last battle, so there's no use for the magic potions. As for the cold fire, spiders and fish, you get those too! I got a giant's wallet pretty early, but I was always full on rupees. I think I wasted about 4 times the rupees I actually got by just taking them while my wallet was full. Speaking of rupees, that renders the reward for the biggest collectathon ever absolutely useless! Like getting 99 lives in Mario 64. It was satisfying finding all the spiders. As for the last battle, it's disappointing, to say the least. You HAVE TO HAVE the magic upgrade, and you can't waste any magic on missing, or testing. If you run out of magic, you have to either reset or kill yourself, wasting all the fairies you saved for the battle. Ganon was ok, I guess. I only felt the need to use a bombchu once in the entire game, which was stupid considering how much attention is given to those things. Also, Navi and Kepora Gebora. Those are truly the only problems in the entire game. It was a visceral experience from start to finish. I loved the music, the battle system, the items, the characters, the weapons, the quests, everything. I especially loved how you can't miss ANYTHING! You can get absolutely everything, anytime you want! (Except after the final battle, but you don't need it then anyway). I loved playing the ocarina freestyle, so the scarecrow song was a really cool thing. The ending kinda made me sad. All those people you helped, met, loved, like they never knew you in the first place. Still, every Ocarina song will stay in my heart, I will never forget any of the beautiful melodies I was taught.

Some moments of it seem awkward, but with those aside, it truly stands as one of the best games ever made. At the time, with it's graphics, game play and story, it truly did stand above the rest.

I'm getting to that.lets start this by saying I'm new to the N64 and the Zelda franchise, I bought my console and a bunch of games a couple of years ago because i wanted to know what all the fuss was about, ""ocarina of time"" this, ""goldeneye"" that. I thought i was really missing something, and i was! i have N64 parties and just play games all night, its loads of fun to just mariokart and goldeneye all night.But this ocarina, I don't know about it. I was struggling to stay focused, the camera angles and ambiguous graphics, not to mention the outrageously laughable controller really takes it's toll on the fun-o-meter. i simply can't have fun when I'm frustrated with the basic elements of game design.The point of a good game, i think, is to be good regardless of age. ultima 4, super mario bros. and populous weren't just good in the 80s, they are still classics and staples of good game design. nostalgia is not an adequate reason to be a great game. i played some games i thought were awesome as a child, and replaying them, I still enjoy them. But as i got older, i started breaking the mechanics and general game structure down and analyzing them, those games wouldn't really hold up. If i gave someone a copy of that game and told him it's the best game of all time, i don't think he would agree with me.But anyway, aside from the obvious problems with camera angles and the god awful controls, which were far better than most N64 titles, i went on my way. I found the plot hooks very weak and unattractive, and the villain had very poor motivations. The dungeons were fairly easy, but there were some ""WTF that's what i supposed to do?"" moments, which are never good in any game. the combat mechanics, are surprisingly good! the programmers could wrestle with this beast of a controller and actually accomplish something nearly usable with it. so i appreciate the effort for that. most of the puzzles are fine, but some require trial-and-error to accomplish, which defeats the purpose of a puzzle, you may as well roll a die if that's how its going to work. the jumping puzzles sometimes like to bite you in the ass, but overall i've seen worse.It's not that the game is bad, its not, its just not that good. its just OK. its just a run of the mill psuedo-rpg that lots of people happen to have nostalgic connection to. its got a charm to it that is matched by other games. The datedness of it gives a sterile and bland aura to it, buts that's just it. bland. I simply couldn't be bothered playing it anymore, it just got too unengaging and i just stopped playing and that was it.overall It's worth a try, maybe you will be one of the many followers of it, but this game has not aged well at all. But what do i know, go out there and find games you do like and stop reading this silly review.but seriously, i enjoy listening to the music more than the game.9/10 music6/10 visuals8/10 game play6/10 story4/10 re-playability5/10 atmosphere6/10 controls",firewarrior2112

Personally, I got bored of walking across the large Hyrule Field without finding anything to fight. What ever happened to the constant barrage of foes that was present in the previous Zelda games. The game has an excellent interface and the fighting is strikingly fun when available. The other area where Zelda fails is the plot. When the first Zelda came out, the whole ""rescue the princess"" cliche was overused enough in games. Nintendo added time travel into the third Zelda, and here we are doing the same thing over and over. The plot is the same, the towns have the same names, and the music is the same!

Any of those will give you more fun for a longer time, more world to explore, and better dungeon puzzles to solve.Even Zelda 2 at least makes more use of vertical space.

I had really never played a zelda game either when I first rented this. Rather than return it I just payed for the game. I remember when I first put the three stones in at the temple of light when I was probably 8 years old, I thought this would be the last boss, the end of the game. I could not believe that 7 more dungeons yet awaited me. The first three dungeons were about the length of the average game back then.

594,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Definitely greatest game on the N64, and the best game ever created. Ocarina of Time gave us revolutionary 3D gameplay and an epic story not to mention one of the nicest looking games on the N64. The game design is truly second to none. You'll be exploring dungeons set in a desert, underwater, in a haunted mansion, in a graveyard and other interesting locales. Although the water dungeon can be infuriating if you miss a small key, the concept of having access to different rooms with different water elevations is genius.  Although the music is in MIDI format, it was a staple in 1998, and the scores are amazing anyway! So many memorable tunes and epic pieces in this game!If I'd mention the story once more, it's that it is an amazing coming of age story. Link as a child is not taken seriously by anyone and is even one shotted by Ganondorf before the time leap. (Also, this is the best incarnation of Ganondorf in a Zelda game in my opinion, as he antagonizes you throughout the game, and it becomes the players desire to finally put him in his place.... not to mention he screws all of Hyrule over after 7 years have passed!! The first time I saw that he followed you into the sacred realm was actually awe inducing. There I was expecting myself to continue on my journey with this sick sword and BAM there comes Ganondorfs theme and im like wtf!). Link then ages 7 years and has to find 6 sages before the showdown with Ganondorf with a totally warped Hyrule. They nailed the story in this game, And for people in 1998, it probably blew their minds. (especially with that Sheik reveal near the end). Honestly, I could go on and on about this game (also the final boss is my favorite final boss in gaming) but I'll stop here.One of the most deserving games of a 10/10 ever.",makosheva7

The game was massive with lots of sidequesting and a degree of freedom that would not be exploided until the arrival of Grand Theft Auto III a few years later. This is the building blueprint of the modern action rpg game. Before it there was none, and though my personal favorite will always be Majora´s mask, I cannot feel but love for the craft and passion implemented into the game as a refinement constructed upon it´s predecesors, specially the excellent ""A Link To the Past"". There is just so much to do, from collecting items, to fishing to hunting Poes, many games nowadays wish they could play as simple, as intuitive and refined as Zelda Ocarina Of Time, the game that rightfully deserves the title of ""Best game of all time"" because of ONE thing... Innovation. (Also, it introduced the whole 1 button everything mechanic, now that I remember).",Siegfried_Noir

Was it bad itself?  I don't believe so - it was difficult:  However it was still masterfully designed, and the way it all tied together was in my opinion beautiful in the end.  Just because something is difficult, it shouldn't mean that it is inherently flawed.  Difficulty is flawed when it's due to bad design - example being  a game like Binding of Isaac where you can go through dungeons with tons of locked doors and chest but not one god damn key included in the entire stage - that's difficulty through bad design rather than difficulty by intention.  Everything about Ocarina of time was absolutely perfect - the dungeon design, the overworld design, the villages, the music, the sound, the control scheme, the item variety... EVERYTHING.  Best game of all time along with Chrono Trigger and Link to the Past, anyone that says otherwise simply doesn't know video games (or doesn't share my exquisite tastes)",gabriot

But I simply cannot give Ocarina of Time anything lower then a 10. This game is on a level of its own. Perhaps the best game to come out on a Nintendo System, this game raised the bar for 3D gaming and still stands at the top.  When OoT came out I immediately begged my parents for this game. Nintendo power raved about this game, and every person I knew with a Nintendo 64 owned it. Once I got a hold of this game I sat in front of my television for weeks until I beat everything this bad boy offered. 13+ years later and I still re-beat this game at least once a year. Any person willing to call themselves a gamer HAS to play this game. From a designer perspective this game was about 10 years ahead of its time in terms of quality gameplay. For those of us old enough to remember video games prior to current and last gen consoles, we all remember the classic side scrollers and there leap to 3D. Unfortunately, most of those series died with the jump to 3-D. Zelda, on the other hand, took that leap and then some with Ocarina of Time. The game is just that good.For those of you who never played a Zelda game before, the Zelda series is composed of Action/Adventure games that put the gamer in a fantasy world known as Hyrule. The gamer always plays as the protagonist, Link, and is almost always sent on a task of rescuing the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the Dark Lord Ganon. Ocarina of Time is no different. The entire story in a nut shell is the ""fairy boy"" Link is sent on a quest to save Hyrule from the clutches of Ganon. During your adventure you must dwell thru 8-9 dungeons, slay massive bosses, and save Princess Zelda. You can expect a great story and about 30 hours of gameplay for your first playthrough. Obvious, those of you wishing to 100% the game will probably need to spend well over 30 hours to complete the entire game without the use of a guide. Moving forward, the gameplay is the ""bread and butter"" of the series. In Ocarina of Time you can expect to tackle hundreds of puzzles, slay tons monsters, obtain dozens of items, and complete many minigames during your adventure. The combat system really shines in this game with the use of ""Z-Targeting."" Z-targeting basically allows the players to lock onto a monster or item with a simple tap of the Z button. This allows the player to stay focused on the enemy they want to be fighting (this was also one of the first games to introduce such a feature). The general idea of Ocarina of Time is to find and complete 8 dungeons before confronting Ganon in a final battle. These dungeons are big and packed with puzzles that test the players skill and knowledge. Each dungeon requires the player to find a certain item and boss key before battling the dungeon's final boss. On top of these dungeons, OoT has a massive overworld where the player can interact with citizens of Hyrule, play minigames, hunt for heart pieces and treasure, or just explore the terrain. As I mentioned before this was a massive game for its time. Most players will spend 30-50 hours completing this game.Finally, the Zelda series is probably most known for its music. OoT continues not to disappoint us and delivers dozens of memorial tunes. From the overworld theme to the magical songs you unlock to help Link in his quest, the music leaves no disappointment. Even 14 years after this game came out, these songs still sound beautiful. Lets just say this game alone made the sales of Ocarina musical instruments soar. There is no words to describe how much I love this game. I'm a typical gamer that enjoys the big shooters that most people play today (CoD, Halo, Gears of War, etc...) Even though I have literally days-weeks of playing time on those games, I still do not consider them anywhere near Zelda; Especially Ocarina of Time. As I said before, I still go back to beat this game at least once a year. The game has aged extremely well and is still a blast to play. Although the graphics and technology may be old, Ocarina of Time still remains the highest scored game by critics world wide. Do yourselves a favor and buy this game for N64, Gamecube, Wii-Virtual Console, or 3DS. Its well worth the $10-30.Graphics 10/10 (for its time)Sound 10/10Gameplay 10/10Re-playability 10/10",Noshotskill

Ever since I first got into this game as a kid I was fascinated by the world, exploring everywhere not knowing where I was going or what to do. Despite this I was captured by the deepness the game had to offer by the expensive world alone...and I wouldn't even get into the story until almost a decade later. The game kept me busy, finding new places with seemingly no end in sight. I would often think the game had literally no end to it. After multiple times renting the game I would finally get a copy for my own eagerly on the Wii, wanting to experience the fullness of a game that I had adored....and I sure wasn't alone in that regard. What I had come to expect was beyond my expectations. I had already played Twilight Princess and that was already a classic to me, but Ocarina of Time went even further than that game could even achieve. The story is simple but well done. The gameplay is as good as it gets, with epic boss battles, clever and balanced puzzles, and an excellent level of challenge that is still unmatched by any game I've played thus far. The atmosphere this world gives is beyond words I could even put down. You want to save Zelda and defeat Ganondorf, and save Hyrule for all the characters you have met along the way and yourself as well. Items are endlessly interesting to discover and you would be surprised to find so many hidden places in one game. Its mind boggling. There are no places to get stuck at without clear and open thinking and exploration. The game doesn't drag on either as you are constantly surprised and interested to see what happens next. To date this is the only game I have ever spent 10 hours playing without stopping. I would never do that again, but that shows how addictive the game is. People say a game is never perfect. Well if this game isn't, it sure comes pretty darn close. I have yet to play a Link to the Past, but I truly do believe that if their is any game that can be called the greatest game ever made, this is one of those games that deserves it.

And in the chance it's not for you at least you could give an educated reason why you don't like it instead of hating it because of the fan base.

In all my years of gaming, playing everything from CoD to Final Fight, from Banjo Kazooie to League of Legends, from Final Fantasy Tactics and Mother to Fallout III and Fire Emblem: Awakening, across two decades of gaming, there has never been a game as perfectly put together as this one. Every pixel in this game is a legacy in and of itself and leaves a truly lasting impression, a LANDMARK in the mind to any who have experienced it. What is there to say about this game, truly? Well simply put, it is a masterpiece. Like the Mona Lisa, or Michelangelo's David. A Truly beautiful work of art that deserves to be recognized with full acclaim as something that shaped the future of all art of its kind and stands to this day as a testimony to the power and creative spirit that goes into the creation of Video Games. The story is simple, though not as simple as it initially seems. The world is chalk full of hidden bits that scream of a deeper mysticism binding this world, from the simple and obvious Hyrule Field skeletons to the subtle and beautiful spinning of the whimsical-but-also-dark Windmill Hut, appropriately dubbed ""?"". The music is simply majestic, from the haunting trills of the Forest Temple and its distorted Link screams to the fantastic, iconic... LEGENDARY ocarina songs. The graphics were unbelievable for the time... and honestly... the only part that doesn't hold up to this day is the texture resolution as the models are decent. They're  not cutting edge, but everything animates smoothly and looks nice, with smooth arcs, etc. The story is classic, iconic... legendary.. and even takes a decent amount of twisting and turning. The gameplay is immaculate and perfectly executed, with the series' best (in my opinion) puzzles combined with the smooth and fantastic difficulty curve lead the player to be immersed in the pleasing swordplay and item based advancement.In short, Ocarina of Time still holds up to this day, standing the test of time to be, in this humble player's opinion, still the greatest game ever made.

So here's the things I like about it;Setting, story, characters, music, gameplay, game mechanics, items, replay value, innovations, quests, open-world exploration, levelling system (or lack of), abilities. There's probably more but you get the point.I could write pages and pages about this game but there's no point. I've played hundreds and hundreds of games over the course of several decades and I still love this game. And this isn't just nostalgia - I've revisited the game multiple times since my original playthrough in 1998 and it still is THAT good. This is something I've tried with other games but sadly they have not withstood the test of time anywhere near as well.There are aspects to this game that developers should be using for their games today - an example of this is the levelling system. No need to for XP bars, skill trees or any of that nonsense. Just keep it simple. You're health goes up slowly as you make progress but doubly as you explore more areas and find secrets. You find new items which reward you with new abilities. It's all you need. Levelling shouldn't be a big deal and should basically be invisible to the player.Anyways, there's only a few reasons why you would be reading my review;1. You've played the game and like it - hello (see '2' if you're looking to play it again).2. You haven't played the game - then I suggest you get the 3DS version. It's the best legitimate version available. If you don't want that then you can get it on the Wii eShop. I'll also remind you that the WiiU has a Wii inside it [not everyone knows this]. So yes, you can play OoT on your WiiU but you'll need an old controller.3. You've played the game and don't like it - thanks for reading anyway.I probably could have left this blank and just let the date of my review say everything I need.

710,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,9,"First off, OoT begins with Link as a little boy. Know idea how old he is, but he seems to be around 7 or 8. Little fairy called Navi flies up to him and wakes him up for no reason. Apparently the world is in danger and this is just enough motivation to get the little tyke to wake up and start his day. Navi is a sort of tutorial person and she can be annoying if you already know what to do.First off, OoT begins with Link as a little boy. Know idea how old he is, but he seems to be around 7 or 8. Little fairy called Navi flies up to him and wakes him up for no reason. Apparently the world is in danger and this is just enough motivation to get the little tyke to wake up and start his day. Navi is a sort of tutorial person and she can be annoying if you already know what to do. But if you are like me and don't mind a refresher, Navi doesn't seem so obnoxious.So Link wakes up and Navi basically explains the Deku Tree (the ONLY tree I know with a mustache) needs to see him. Now I as the player begin to move him around with the little joystick and make him run outside his little tree house. Looks like we're in a forest; the Kokiri Forest to be exact. First instinct is to explore around, learn how to pick up rocks and throw them, learn to break pots, run through grass to find stray rupees, and of course find out that Mido is a real jerk. Not sure how he does this, but he slides all the way around the area he is guarding and doesn't let you in because Link is ""different"" somehow. By the way, Mido is the leader of the Kokiri Forest children running around.A bit peeved, I run around looking for a sword and shield just like Navi told me to do after saying 'Hello' to Mido (ironically, Link cannot speak). As I find the sword and shield buy dodging rolling boulders and cutting people's lawns for any money I found, I noticed something strange. All these kids running around... not ONE. SINGLE. ADULT!! It was like watching Ed, Edd, and Eddy and wondering the same thing: who watches these children? Does anybody care at all what happens to them!? So I get the sword and shield and shove them in Mido's face and he begrudgingly lets me pass. Off to visit the Deku Tree!Apparently this old sap was dying and I had to go inside his mouth and kill something to make him feel better. This is the first dungeon of the game. This is where the puzzle aspect comes into play. I was climbing webs, pushing blocks, looting chests, getting lost, freaking out at these huge spiders with skulls as abomens as they drop from the ceiling, and, my favorite hobby, burning things with sticks! Eventually I reached a point where I just couldn't go further. So, got lost again and bumped my head into a chest containing a slingshot. This slingshot was going to help further my progress by allowing me to shoot things from a safe distance.Finally found the last room where the apparent evil that was killing the Deku Tree was hiding and boy was it dark! Walking around cautiously I hear the same sound that the spiders made when they were moving. Of course, I look up to see if I was right... oh I was right alright. In fact, I was so right the game went widescreen, zoomed in on this spider and it reveals one big orange eye that glares at me with such contempt. The eight-legged freak drops from the ceiling and some white text appears: Parasitic Armored Arachnid GOHMA! I believed myself to be knee deep in scat at this point, so I ran around frantically hoping Navi would say something useful for once! Gohma gets close to me and stands upright, focusing a red glaring eye upon me. Navi finally uses her magical power to pause the game and hint that I should poke its eye. Really Navi? You want me to irritate this guy by poking it in the DAMN EYE!? Fine. I'll shoot a pebble in the eye and see if Gohma gets some more redness and asks Ben Stein for some eyedrops. Apparently shooting a slingshot hurt a lot more than I thought! Gohma falls down and her eye is flashing all sorts of colors. I pull out my twig-sized sword and hack away. Gohma gets back up after 4 slashes and we do this dance allover again. Run around, stand in fear as Gohma begins to stare into my soul with her crimson gaze, fling a pebble in her eye, watch her fall down, pull out twig, smack her with it, and then she dissipates.Got that out of the way, but apparently the Deku Tree's doctor only gave him so much time to live. In other words, I was too late. The tree was dying and he gives Link a Kokiri Emerald. I guess I should keep it. After all, it's a parting gift and it is shiny. But there is more to this game than just killing time in dungeons, solving puzzles, laying the smack down on spiders bigger than any boot you will ever find, and then watching the trees die! There are mini-games, sidequests, weapons galore, secrets, fairies, engrossing story developments, songs to play, adventures to be had, and NPCs who may strike you as odd, peculiar, creepy, and even pretty. The game's main mechanic has got to be the Ocarina of Time. It is used in many places to open doors, raise water levels, turn night into day, teleport Link to previous locations, and even make it rain! I would say more, but I don't want to spoil anything else. OoT is just a timeless classic that never gets old.",RiotKnight

Link's destiny is to defeat the evil Ganondorf (The Gerudo King) and save Princess Zelda. There is much to the story but I don't want to spoil too much.Gameplay: The gameplay was pretty good for the most part, just gets extremely frusterating because of the lack of buttons on the N64 controller. I praise the Z-Targeting in the game as without it, it would be an extremely hard. The enemies that will piss you off the most are the bats and other flying creatures as they are the hardest to aim at.Sound: I found OOT funny in the sense that Link always makes the HYAH HYEAH HEYA HUP for every action you do besides running or walking. Didn't come across too many SFX issues because everything I hit sounded exactly how I think it would sound in real life.Music: This soundtrack is incredible. Its so memorable and I see how people can keep humming or whistling this song wherever you go. A personal favourite of mine is Kakoriko Town followed up by the Song of Storms song in the windmill (Both places centered around Kakoriko Town :D). I certainly can't wait to play Majoras Mask and see their memorable soundtracks too!!Characters: 85% of characters are very minor and do nothing with the story, but they are memorable and you know what type of traits they carry. Like the couple swinging around in the Castle Marketplace which they do that 24/7 and never get tired. The only characters that you will probably remember are Zelda, Ganondorf and Mido that little prick.Textures/Graphics/Design: That true N64 look, reused textures and the polygonal shapes everywhere. It looks aged as of today, but that still doesn't stop me from thinking how mind-blowing it was back in the day, a truly wonderful and unique world.Random Notes: Although I bought this game at a garage sale for fairly cheap (N64 version), you are best off emulating it or getting the 3DS version (Pirating is wrong mkay) the N64 title is highly demanded will cost a lot.Do you recommend? YesHow long did it take you to beat? Approx. 25 hours (I collected a lot of items and did the side quests)What's the best part about the game? The soundtrackWhat's the worst part about the game?

The Great Deku Tree summons a fairy by the name of Navi to aid Link in his quest to save Hyrule from destruction. Navi finds LInk in his bed and tells him the Great Deku Tree has summoned him. Link agrees to visit the Great Deku Tree and learns that he has placed a curse on him by the main villain of the game, he is asked to remove the curse. Once Link removes the curse the Deku Tree tells him that Hyrule is in danger, he asks Link to find the princess of the land and begins his quest to save Hyrule.Gameplay:You begin the game with nothing in your inventory, you have to find a sword to fight your way through the monsters you encounter in the game along with a shield to go with it. You find rupees which are used as the currency in the game to buy items, this is very useful for buying potions and miscellaneous items such as deku sticks, nuts, seeds, and arrows to aid Link. The combat is very easy to learn right off the bat, you find a sword and can side slash, jump slash, or stab your opponents.The game is open world with tons of collectibles to collect throughout, such as extra heart pieces, gold skulltullas to upgrade wallet capacity, and secret locations. You encounter dungeons you must to do progress the main game, every dungeon is enjoyable to play through, the puzzles are simple to learn, and the bosses are uniquely designed. At the end of each dungeon will earn an extra heart container to increase health capacity, plus you will earn an item that you need to progress. The Water Temple is the hardest dungeon in the game, the layout is confusing to learn, but nevertheless still very fun to play through every time.Graphics:The game looks fantastic, it is beautiful to look at, much like Super Mario 64. The game can lag at times depending on what console you play on (Virtual Console, Gamecube, Nintendo 64, iQue), it is an old game after all.Music:The original score is just as great as any other Zelda game, being composed by Koji Kondo, his score is  as great as the previous games. The music sets the mood no matter where you are in the game, the score is one of the best in video game history.Final Opinion:Ocarina of Time is considered to be the greatest game ever made, there is so much to do in the game that it will keep you entertained all the way through.

Most of those people are probably in puberty.Now to the game:Zelda - Ocarina of Time is a Masterpiece. Released in 1998 (1 Year earlier than Castlevania 64, which has awful graphics, controls and gameplay, but is comparable) it was the 2. Nintendo 64 Game with really good Controls. It was also, after Mario 64 , the first Action Adventure worth playing on Nintendo 64.The Game is packed full with secrets, collectables and content. You were introduced to Epona, a now iconic Horse in the Zelda Universe and could also ride it - In a fun and entertaining way.The characters, for the time, were scary or hilarious, entertaining or evil. You could tell pretty fast what kind of NPC you are facing, which was a challenge due the lack of high resolution textures.Link, the main character, was sympathic and easy to love.The graphics, for it times, were amazing. You felt like LIVING in Hyrule and everything you did wasnt just Link, it was you.The amount of dungeons was impressive. So much content for a N64 Game wasnt something you could just expect. Even compared to AAA Titles today, the Game still stands out as high class.To be fair, the 3D Remake for the 3DS wasnt necessary. But it gave people today the chance to play this Masterpiece, so it is absolutely fine.Sure, for me, this title offers also nostalgic feelings and memories of months of entertainment. But isnt that also something the game achieved? Entertain me in 98 and made me fall in love?The Game is dated. It is, absolutely. If you want to play it, buy the 3DS Version and enjoy a great Adventure while you are in the train, bus or at home on the couch.",BatLB

Another problem I have with the game is that although all of the bosses in the game are good, not many stand out as interesting or unique. This doesn't mean they are bad however as some of them are brilliant like the sisters in the Spirit Temple and the Forest Temple boss but the others are mediocre or to simple like the first boss in the Deku Tree.The positives however are that the world feels unique and lived in, unlike some that feel unrealistic. Everything you do feels important no matter what the task is as you are helping a world that you can care so much about. The items are all interesting with some of the most common items in there as well. I always love to play the ocarina as all the songs are different and are brilliantly composed but that is true with every piece of music and I would sometimes find myself whistling song's like Saria's song (The Lost Woods theme tune) or Gerudo Valleys theme tune. Hyrule field is a bit empty but is still a beautiful place to just walk or ride around in. I also like the controls and the Z targeting but sometimes you might do something you don't want to but that rarely happens when I play. The dungeons and temples are fun (except the Water Temple) as it puts puzzles in certain environments and can't be found in other areas. The ending is fun and fulfilling but to make this as spoiler free as possible I'm not going to talk about it.Thanks for reading.",TheStudioBoy

Even for someone like me who's only playing it now, I can say the game was absolutely amazing. I may just be a jaded millennial, but I can definitely see why people loved this game so much. It really set the standard for what modern Zelda games are all about.It goes through the same motions as all the others, of course. Go into a dungeon, get an item, use it to beat the boss. It's the standard thing that all Zelda games do over and over, but I'm not knocking points off of it because it did this first. Even if it wasn't the first to do it, I'd probably still love the game just as much. The world feels huge despite its actually relatively small size, feeling much larger and livelier than many of the much bigger open world games that I've played. There's tons to do, and no matter how many times I play the thing, I never find myself becoming bored. The world is fun to explore, and the dungeons are very well designed, never being a completely linear experience, but never feeling like it just leaves you without any clue as to what to do. I love exploring and figuring out the dungeons in this game, they're absolutely some of the best parts of the game. Of course I hear the Water Temple was some legendary rite of passage to separate the boys from the men, but I never found that much trouble with it. It was more complex than others, sure, but the same rules applied. Just explore rooms you haven't been to, yet. It wasn't really that difficult for me, even if it had three separate and sprawling floors.Even as someone who jumped onto Ocarina of Time late, I can still feel the magic in this title. I fell in love with the game after the first dungeon, and I felt compelled to keep going through the story, exploring the dungeons and slaying the monsters, and the second half of the game feels even better than the first half when you're jumping back and forth through time. Shifting from child to adult form is the main selling point of this game, and it's used to solve puzzles and such things in certain sections of the game. Although only one dungeon really incorporates it completely, it can be used in exploration throughout the world, and it's always fun to come across something and experiment with time to see what works.This is my personal favorite Zelda title, though I haven't played all of them, but even so I don't think my opinion is controversial. This is definitely a masterpiece, and any shortcomings it may have are overshadowed by its overall amazing quality and the magical experience it provides, even after all the years after its initial release.",Ishi123

I personally think the learning curve of the game is because of the clunkiness of the game and a few monsters not unfair but still not perfect. The dungeons at times are really not my thing. Many Zeldas have their ""stone wall rooms"" in their dungeons but this one here has really a lot of them with just a few details. You just feel that the dungeons basically are a few blocks of rock (except for the first three).

And while this part I'm about to mention gets better when you become an adult but it is still a flaw of the game, all i can remember from the part of the game where you are a child is side strafing and rolling across Hyrule field because there was nothing to do in Hyrule field.

However in order to doHailed as a flawless masterpiece. While definitely deserving of praise during its release, the Ocarina of Time wasn't as perfect as its community believes it to be. It is still something worth playing today, preferably with the 3DS version.Points against:Numerous fetch missions - The game itself would be a masterpiece if relegated to dungeons and exploration. However in order to do anything in the game, an NPC will demand you fetch some type of item or the quest line will forcibly require you to go and hunt down a tool necessary to reach a dungeon.Lack of direction - A lot of finding the right way to go in Zelda games is primarily luck based, Ocarina is no exception. Once the Owl stops feeding you directions, the expansive world area becomes a tedious adventure in finding things that you haven't done yet, and then finding the NPC that requires finding the item that you need to successfully advance. The later-game area is by far one of the most frustrating and confusing areas to traverse with little help in game other than to just attempt everything.Illusion of Difficulty - Most of the game isn't difficult, but really a period of waiting and countering. Dungeons are complex and rewarding, but often the slog of forced battles can become tedious and often just result in a player getting exhausted. In longer dungeons this becomes especially prevalent. Even the bosses are mostly just guard-and-wait type enemies.Upsides:Dungeons and Exploration - The world of Hyrule is vast and immediately accessible, and encourages a lot of trial and error. Once the exploration becomes a mandatory event, it does lose a lot of luster.Content - The game is lush with content and items to collect and things to see and explore. With fishing, horse racing, poe-catching, even though there are some frustrating moments to those events, are a healthy distraction to the late game's issues regarding its lack of direction.Narrative - The series strongly continues to be flush with vibrant light scenes and dark tones, characters are engaging and perform their roles in the story without becoming overbearing or losing interest.Iron Knuckle - Best inclusion of an enemy. While most monsters are pursuit or guard-and-wait, the Iron Knuckle is a pure reactionary enemy that genuinely challenges the player with each encounter. If more enemies or bosses performed like the Iron Knuckle, then the game would definitely be stronger overall.",DoctorZack

There are very few games that grab hold of your imagination from the very start and keep you immersed the whole way through. It is a stunning achievement on almostA Masterpiece that has stood the test of time and even to this day remains one of the best games on the market. From the very opening moments of the game I got the feeling that Ocarina of Time was going to be something special. There are very few games that grab hold of your imagination from the very start and keep you immersed the whole way through. It is a stunning achievement on almost every level and when you compare it with other games of its generation it is in a class of its own. In recent years I often hear people say that Ocarina of Time is overrated I can only assume that those people never played it at the time of its release. Is it still the best Zelda game in every way? No, of course it isn't it's nearly 20 years old. The fact that it is still the best in some ways though is a testament to just how amazing it was. It set the bar in so many levels. When it came out there was nothing like it. It is nearly a perfectly balanced game, that set the bar for all games that followed. I replayed all of the 3D Zelda games recently and it still easily ranks near the top.The Gameplay is good on almost every level. it is a nearly perfect blend of puzzle solving, exploration, combat and platforming. It also has a menu system that was genius for its time and made every item in your inventory easy to access. Certainly there are better menu systems in some of the new Zelda games but Ocarina of Time provided the general model that all those games built on. Combat is not the best but as you get more items it gets progressively deeper and actually requires more skill than the vast majority of similar games. While many of the boss battles are simple, each one requires a unique strategy that you need to learn through trial and error. Unlike many other games in the series there is very little repetition. There is a huge variety of puzzles and problem solving both in and out of dungeons. Another great thing about the puzzles is that as you progress further you need to use more of your items and skills together to solve. The game naturally trains you through the experience of your adventure, making progression very rewarding. The level of freedom in this game was simply amazing for its time and it took many years for it to be surpassed.While Zelda games have never been known for great story lines, Ocarina of Time is easily one of the best. Unlike past Zelda games, the character of Link actually grows up and that transition is handled brilliantly. When Link is a child he deals with problems in a naive way. When you play as a child you feel like a child in a world full of mysteries that you don't understand. When Link eventually grows up it becomes immediately apparent that things were not as simple as they originally seemed and you are forced to face the hard realities of the adult world. The story is still relatively simple but it is a simple story told extremely well with many great twists and turns. The game does an excellent job of betraying your expectations. It also builds on the lore of the Zelda universe in a meaningful way. Like most Zelda games the story takes a backseat to the gameplay but it still provides plenty of memorable plot points. It was well paced and kept me engaged from beginning to end.The world in Ocarina of Time is very small by modern standard but it felt massive for its time and due to its great design it still feels relatively large because of the sheer variety of locations. Each area has a very distinct feel and due to the pass of time each area changes dramatically. As you get more items you will also find yourself revisiting old areas and gaining access to them. Ocarina of Time has probably the best variety of dungeons in any Zelda game. Every single one feels unique and offers different highlights. There are 9 main dungeons 3 mini dungeons. Not only that but gaining access to each of the dungeons also requires some puzzle solving which makes it all the more rewarding. The sheer amount of areas and diversity of those areas insures that the game never gets repetitive. Not only are the environments well varied but as the game progresses you gain new ways to travel more efficiently which makes back tracking far easier. The game enables you to fast travel as soon as traversal starts to become a chore.The Visuals might not seem like anything special now but at the time they were amazing. Seriously look back at other games of that gen and try to find games that have aged better graphically.The Sound Design remains some of the best in any game. Not only is the music excellent it is used as a game mechanic in the most meaningful way I have seen in a game. It is without a doubt a masterpiece.Ocarina of TIme is objectively a great game, people don't have to like it but to deny its excellence is plain ignorance. It was a leap forward in many areas and changed the way games are viewed. It is well deserving its accolades.",artificeprime

What starts out with a bright happy forest full of smiling children quickly turns dark, and keeps this tend of switching between light and dark themes throughout the entire story. see, this game is from the generation of games i like to call the pre-perfection age, the era of games setting up and leading to what i believe are some of the best games ever, like Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Final Fantasy X. (this an opinion just to clarify.) This is one of those games that defined its genre on release, and inspired the games that perfected the formula. The story is long and interesting, using areas and plot points we have seen before but taking them to a whole other level. Each area is important to the plot and is packed with secrets and interesting puzzles. While the main central area,  Hyrule Field, does feel empty by today's standards, you have to realize none of this had ever been done before, and to create such a massive and interesting world on the first try amazes me to this day. I always enjoy finding enemies to slash my sword into, and even today, it feels fairly smooth and responsive. each dungeon is special in its own way, with its own key puzzle mechanic being fleshed out in a plethora of ways. whether your traversing a giant tree, searching for hidden pathways using a magical all seeing lens, or exploring the ancient temple full of ghosts, phantoms, and some spooky-ass music, there is rarely a low point, or a bad mechanic in this game. rarely.While this game has some of the most memorable characters, places and moments in video game history, It easily has one the worst, most frustrating and awful moments in gaming history. THE WATER TEMPLE. I HATE THE WATER TEMPLE. What started out as a great mechanic, using music to raise and lower the water levels to access certain areas became the worst dungeon in Zelda history, and is why water themed dungeons get a bad rap. Its annoying to traverse, the underwater controls are frustrating and badly designed, and to top it all off, ITS CONFUSING AS HELL. I cant even do it today without a walk through and Ive done it more than once, at least 3 times. Did i also mention the bosses? they range from great! i love the mechanic and how it blends into the boss so seamlessly, and total garbage. (again, my opinion) Bongo Bongo, being the worst, is maddening to deal with, i never seam to get the battle right, i always die several times, getting shoved back really far into the dungeon, just to get back and get destroyed because of how awkward he it is to fight. the Golden skulltulla quest is also ridiculously hard to complete, because of how hidden they are with little to no clues as to whether or not they are there.This game is also nearing 20 years old, and was venturing into land unknown, and to create a game of this caliber has only been done a few times before. and the genre learned from its mistakes, taking into account all it did right and wrong, to create more stellar experiences. This game is a must play for everyone, and if you haven't played it yet, i highly suggest you do. you wont understand the amazing reviews and the greatness of the series if you don't experience this game at least once, so get off your couch, hop onto the Wii U, and download this. trust me, you'll thank me later.",TriGamer
842,The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo64,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Ocarina of Time is acclaimed to a level that few other titles are. Years after it's original release, it still holds up. Every quest, every village, every dungeon is an adventure in itself. Locations such as Lon Lon Ranch and Kakariko village are some of the most memorable in any video game; due to their distinct inhabitants, and memorable music. There are tedious sections, like the infamous Water Temple, and the escape from Gerudo Fortress, which do impede on the experience somewhat. Despite this, OoT remains an incredibly entertaining game, and one that will likely remain one as long as video games exist.",ashketchum

Despite with almost no voice acting the story is showed by text like the previous entry in the series and with the use of body expression or even a little bit of face expression does help the story.  The story is your usual save the princess with a few problems in narrative along the way.  The character models look blo-cky while others look amazing especially the bosses.  The draw distance is a huge improvement over Body Harvest the game that came out a mere two months earlier.  The scope of the game may not be bigger than Body Harvest but it sure is more detailed.  The mix of puzzle solving in the dungeons with a tight sword combat system helps the game to be more fun.  You can only jump automatically but it barely gives a problem while also the camera is better than Super Mario 64 overall by staying behind the silent protagonist then the camera does zoom in to much, when you lock on an enemy.  Not letting you see the edges of a cliff for example, another small problem is since you don't have a horse at first you will be walking a lot in which might bother a few players but not a real flaw.  The Soundtrack is fantastic and still holds up even today also the game adds items to collect, rewards, secret areas, power ups, magic, the use of an arrow in first person view and it truly shows the effort being put in the game when you see the enemy being variant that makes the world even more alive.  The reason I don't consider this game a total masterpiece is because of the water temple making you use the menu way too many times for just changing your boots and that you need to go back to a shop if you don't have any arrows for example making you spend more time than it should.

When 007 Goldeneye proved that even on simple cartridge technology that great First Person Shooter single player and multiplayer experiences where possible, the genre exploded at the thought of the possibilities. Perfect Dark is a indirect sequel to 007 Goldeneye in the sense of improved engine, interface and features even though it was not related to James Bond at all. The storyline is beautifully crafted with the ability to play the story mode in single player, co-op, and counter-operative (your friend controls enemy guards).

Perfect Dark has THE BEST Multiplayer around; the ""Simulants"" (Console-controlled Bots) outshine most other games, and frankly any game that came out after Perfect Dark that DIDN'T include Bots cannot be forgiven of this crime.

Both are masterful music groups with masterful music. Perfect Dark is a masterpiecePerfect Dark is the most perfect first person shooter videogame ever created. I know that is a bold claim, and the game is not everybody's cup of tea. But why should art have to apologise just because it was designed with an ethos some find disagreeable? Do we judge Pink Floyd for not sounding like Queen? Both are masterful music groups with masterful music. Perfect Dark is a masterpiece of video-game design. If players are unable to tolerate the slow pacing, lack of hand-holding, or the science fiction storyline, that is really their own fault.Perfect Dark is filled with features which 13 years of development since have failed to recapture: Destroyable lighting, locational damage on enemies, surrendering AI, an array of clever weapons, non-lethal combat as a viable option, and alternate means of completing common objectives.The story is clever, humourous, and told very well via voiced conversations and cutscenes which book-end each mission. Joanna Dark is an interesting protagonist. I can't think of any videogame with a better female lead.Also of note is the multiplayer functionality, including well-designed cooperative, the combat simulator, and the inclusion of key maps from Goldeneye.Some people complain about this game's framerate. Let me tell you a cute little fact. Perfect Dark runs at a maximum of 50 or 60 frames per second, depending on whether your copy is PAL or NTSC. To compare, Ocarina of Time is capped at 17-20 frames per second. The sluggish framerate is noticable during heavy action in Perfect Dark because the game is capable of running at a much higher framerate at other times. And to be frank, the framerate is not as bad as people make out, and certainly much better than Goldeneye's.It's difficult for me to submit this review. I fear I haven't expressed just how beautiful this game is. It changed my life, and has continued to inspire me to this day. It deserves the title of greatest first person shooter ever created, and I suggest it deserves to be considered among the greatest video-games ever created. You owe it to yourself to play this game with an open mind, and most importantly LEARN how to play it. If you've been bought up on Modern Warfare and Quake, this game will be a plodding, dull experience. But if you have a taste for Deus Ex, and games which require the player to think in order to be completed, you will enjoy it. Just make sure you find a control scheme which feels comfortable first. The default is not particularly good for aiming.That is all I can think to say. I love Perfect Dark.",Ambient_Malice

They wanted to do a lot of this at the time of GE007 but 007 is its own licence so they waited to put it in their own product.

If you were one of those people that always wanted to play 007 with others but couldn't, this is the game to play because not only did it have multiplayer but it had game modes where you could play against computers (or what as they call ""simulants"") without having to play with  a real person.

It had over 50 different guns and some guns could use x-ray vision to see and shoot through walls. The campaign mode is great and it makes a lot of sense. One thing that made the game even more awesome is the fact that you had to have a compatible control pack to play the game because the game has so much memory for the Nintendo 64 to handle.

However, I still think that Goldeneye improved on the forumula with great graphics and decent multiplayer (for its time). On the contrast, PD brought to us multiple weapon modes (that were actually awesome), an interesting storyline (unlike Goldeneye), great music (Goldeneye was OK here), the 'laptop gun' (Goldeneye/other FPS titles had NOTHING like this), Psychosis gun (Again, GE/other FPS had nothing like this), bots (not in Goldeneye either--and, with some degree of uncertainty, other PC FPS's preceding PD), etc etc etc Goldeneye was great, but it wasn't the template for FPS's succeeding it. Rather, it was merely a way for console gamers to access what PC gamers had been playing YEARS prior. Perfect Dark blew Goldeneye out of the water because it was a new template for following FPS's, and because it extended FPS's into dimensions BEYOND gameplay (with its great story, voice-acting, and music). Try bringing a cogent argument to the table next time, Mr. Bond/John P...you know, other than 'Goldeneye is a superior game because mommy wouldn't let me play M-rated titles when PD came out'. Again, not denying that GE was a good game, but that it wasn't what following shooters were based on (THAT argument only holds true if you really ARE waste of genetic material).",JoannaD.

14390,GoldenEye 007,Nintendo64,5,"Without benefit of nostalgia goggles, a perfectly mediocre game.The AI is as crude as, say, Doom's, but much less responsive. Never seen characters flatly ignore so much carnage around them. Plus, the AI lacks any features that lead to interesting mechanics (c.f. Doom's monster infighting). They run up & shoot & no more. While it gets the job done, it's bizarre to see the AI praised.Without benefit of nostalgia goggles, a perfectly mediocre game.The AI is as crude as, say, Doom's, but much less responsive. Never seen characters flatly ignore so much carnage around them. Plus, the AI lacks any features that lead to interesting mechanics (c.f. Doom's monster infighting). They run up & shoot & no more. While it gets the job done, it's bizarre to see the AI praised. GoldenEye did nothing to advance the art.Shooting is surprisingly satisfying for a game with no gore, thanks to varied, hilariously flamboyant hit reaction & death animations, yet the extraordinarily rapid infinite respawning of enemies quickly sucks all the joy out of dispatching them. Run-n-gun is quite fun here except that it's trivial, and the only real threats are (spawning forever) behind you. You need eyes on the back of your head. Stealth elements feel tacked-on, and just bog down the game. The counter-intuitive marriage of arcadey shooting (GoldenEye's light-gun game roots show) with stealth may be possible, but Rare botched it.Level design has a couple high points but through most of the game it's either too linear or pointlessly expansive, in the latter case mostly via extremely repetitious, boring, & constricted 90-degree-angle interiors. It's so easy to get lost, because everything looks identical. The few moments where there's real room for flexibility are welcome. GoldenEye kicked off the unfortunate trend of ""realistic"" level design and is one of the worst examples of its use. Objectives are mostly unobtrusive thematic fluff, but some of them are vague (copy the key?) or frustrating (the ole' escort-the-dumb-bullet-sponge objective again & again). Doesn't help that there's zero saving within missions, automatic or manual. Oh, and unmarked exits that abort your mission and force a restart, they're fun too.A constant bugbear is a low and wildly inconsistent framerate, where the drops often have nothing to do with the on-screen action. Even in 1997 this was no technical masterpiece. Aesthetically it's a mixed bag. Some environments play to the strengths of the hardware, while others are just awful. Throughout, the artistry behind textures is mediocre.Many fondly recall GoldenEye for its multiplayer. Can't comment on that. For certain, the single-player is far from timeless, versus its contemporaries & ancestors. GoldenEye's innovation and influence can't be denied, but glowing praise of its quality per se is even more dubious today. A console FPS, what'll they think of next!FWIW I first played GoldenEye around 2003, having been an FPS fan since the early 90s. I came in with enthusiasm & high expectations due to so much lavish praise, and left disillusioned. It's an instructive example of naivete about other peoples' opinions. There were legitimate reasons why people loved GoldenEye. Quality is bottom of the list.",JimmyThickNThin

Now it'll be hard to convince a 9 year old today that this is an amazing game that is an absolute blast but for those who truly appreciate video games and the time when video games brought friends into your household for hours and hours of shooting glory defending a bathroom, this is a timeless classic.

So, on its own, if it were released today; it would not stand a whole lot of a chance. For the time, though, it was pretty legit. The story mode kept true to the great movie and was also fun for the most part (excluding the missions ""Silo"", ""Train"", and, ""Control"") The graphics were decent and it is relatively replayable to an extent. The multiplayer was varied and makes for a good time. The music is genius and sets an appropriate atmosphere. All of this, though, does not negate the fact that the game is way too overrated by nostalgia-blind fanatics. Some of the missions were repetitive and bland, such as ""Silo"". It wasn't very easy to keep track of health during gameplay because it would only show up when you were hurt and it wasn't very precise with its unshaded coloring. The friendly AI is infamously poor and made a few missions feel broken. Furthermore, the awkward Nintendo 64 controller made the controls feel lopsided, but GoldenEye 007 can't change the controller, so no blame to the game there.

And that's what Goldeneye 64 is --- not a game but a cultural touchstone for anyone who grew up playing shooters in the 90s. When Goldeneye was released, using a PC was the only credible way to play an FPS. Sure, there were ports of Doom and Wolfenstein to consoles, but they were not worth their salt.  Then came Goldeneye and the paradigm was shifted forever, paving the way for the likes of Halo and Call of Duty. Goldeneye was the first game to credibly use a gamepad to control an FPS. And while the sprawling maps and stealth mechanic of the single-player campaign offered hours of great content, it was the split-screen multiplayer that made this game a true classic. As a lifelong fan of James Bond who has been playing FPS since the original Wolfenstein, Goldeneye hits a sweet spot with me that few games have rivaled before or since. Is it as good as you remember? Of course not, the FPS genre has taken monumental leaps forward since this game was released and the clumsy N64 controller is a medieval torture device compared to modern gamepads. Is it still worth playing. Of course! Goldeneye 64 is like the Casablanca of video games. It may be old but it's still better than most of what has come since.",Mrman7

Yes, we all know that the dual-joystick configuration changed the FPS genre for the better. Unfortunately, it didn't exist until a certain point.

Naturally, this was extremely hard to live up to and that is the most likely reason for the more negative opinion. Personally I found the game absolutely brilliant. As a sequel to Ocarina of Time it took the basic features of it and enhanced and twisted them into a darker and more perilous setting - Termina. Right from the beginning we can see that the game is darker, with the enigmatic travelling mask salesman and the mystery surrounding Majora's Mask. The whole mask concept is really what makes the game stand out, adding a multitude of side quests and new gameplay as well as making the game feel a lot more dark and mysterious. As many other reviews have said, the game was hard but for me that' part of what made it so great - the increased difficulty not only adds to the challenge but makes the game feel more dark and twisted when compared with Ocarina of Time. Overall I just feel that Majora's Mask captured the feel of Ocarina of Time and put a unique take on it making the game feel very fresh and just plain awesome.",DomF

Dark and unsettling, Ocarina of Time is slightly better on overall gaming experience but Majora's Mask actually has perks that makes it equal or sometimes even better than Ocarina of Time to a certain point. MM pretty much has the most unique story set up in all of the Zelda game; save a town from a falling moon in 3 days. No princess or other important people to save, no Ganondorf. Just save a town from doom. The gameplay is actually a tad better with improve jump and combat mechanics and though the map is smaller, it has more life. The 3 day clock system is pretty much genius, making the gameplay more interesting and fun. Last but not least is the dark and disturbing atmosphere and satisfyingly difficult gameplay, adding with the 3 day clock system makes a very tense experience. Going back on going between MM or OoT, I suggest to buy and play BOTH of these games. Both games are the best the N64 has to offer.",muzziklover

I know why many like OoT better too, and when I first played OoT I couldn't imagine a Zelda game being better, however that was before I got my hands on MM the day it was released and saw that (for me, not everyone) I enjoy a darker and more ominous game (The Last of Us, Bioshock, Metro 2033), one of the things i remember most from my childhood is the day I got MM was turned into a deku scrub which was clearly devastating to link, met the ""happy"" mask salesman, and then was thrust into the world of termina with that  as a kid anyway  extremely scary looking moon making its way towards clock town to crush and kill its inhabitants. People will say MM copied OoT's graphics, this I do not understand, it was a game made by the same company, in the same time period, on the same console, with the same engine, but this was on purpose, this was not a cash grab like fallout new vegas this was something truly original but made on the same hardware. I don't hear you new gamers saying, oh modern warfare 2 copied modern warfares graphics, or black world at war copied modern warfare 2's graphics, or black ops copied world at war's graphics, or modern warfare 3 and BO2 copied all of the aboves graphics (all true) because it is one franchise on one console, why shouldn't they use a tried and true engine that works well. This being said clock town is head and shoulders above the castle town in OoT with its pre rendered environments which gives the appearance of walking on a painting like a PSX final fantasy game. Not to mention the masks? Come on the mask system is one of my favorite things from any game not just the transformation masks you come across on your main quest but the many many others that make for some great side quests and mini games. People complain about the 3 day system as well which I very much enjoyed, it's not that bad guys play the inverted song of time and you will have plenty of time to get a lot done in these 3 days. I loved how certain things happen on certain days and if you miss it you have to wait until the next go around. Anyway not saying I don't have an enormous amount of respect and love for the classic Ocarina of Time, but way more side quests, transformations, a cool and ominous storyline, a darker and more twisted world and characters. These things make MM my all time favorite Zelda game and one of my all time favorite video games to date.  I wrote this review not to disprove the nay sayers, but to state my opinion and hopefully inspire some younger gamers who have a Wii or Wii U to use that virtual console feature and experience one of gaming's best titles.",QRayhart

I dare someone to come up with a game with a story as complex as this one is. All the work that had to be put into making this time system and all these events line up....it's just a masterpiece. I'm giving OoT a 10 also, but Majora's mask is my personal favourite.",Cerberus0
22992,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Nintendo64,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        This title’s grim motif conveys a unique contrast to the livelier, past installments of the Zelda franchise that mirrors its predecessor’s ability to deliver an inimitable experience. Majora is the first of its kind to enable players revisit old dungeon bosses. Although there are only a few to revisit, perhaps the most amusing part of revisiting boss battles is in using the Fierce Deity’s Mask, which pays homage to Adult Link in Ocarina. The game also features a new soundtrack, although the Lost Woods music makes its return. Another area where Majora makes reference to Ocarina is in the Termina Field area leading to Snowhead, where a musical staff displays a melody from Ocarina. When Link plays the sequence correctly, he is rewarded with rupees.Players, however, will find their attention sidetracked by the three-day time limit with its embedded restrictions. The mask collection gives a fun side quest appeal to the overall experience, enhancing the game’s completeness piece by piece, only to be taxed by the limited extent of the game’s overall length otherwise. Rather than showcase a vast array of dungeons and puzzles, the game blitzes timed events with a few critical items but greater in number still are the masks, most of which serve no practical purpose.Overall, the main difference between Ocarina and Majora lies in the smaller details. Whereas Ocarina players sold masks for the salesman, Majora expands on that mechanic, allowing Link to explore the story behind each mask. Ocarina had one single long trade sequence leading to the Biggoron Sword, while Majora had many side quests with multiple rewards. Most of its similarities are due to the fact that the game was originally proposed as an expansion to the original, later to become a standalone game after the N64 Disk Drive project was scrapped.Verdict 8.5/10+ Familiarity+ Expanded mask collection and abilities+ New soundtrack+ Revisit bosses and side quests- 3 day time constraint",RobertTPooner

22999,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Nintendo64,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        **Could contain minor spoilers**I LOVE the game! It has so many things to enjoy. Every NPC has his/her own story to follow. And every time you replay the days you get to follow any story you like. It is a very original game overall and the cutscenes and the way the story is told is brilliant. I also love the deeper meaning this game has with the masks of how we all carry many different masks from time to time but we are still the same person underneath. And how Skull kid carries a mask just because he thought he wasn't accepted the way he was when it turns out that there is nothing wrong with him, the mask was the thing that were wrong. This game is filled with action, drama, philosophy, mysteries, secrets and so much more. And the detail that gives the game an even greater experience is to be able to play the role of the legendary Deku, Goron and the Zora and to be able to use their different skills. Simply amazing.Many complain about that the graphics are old but the game is from year 2000 so that's how the graphics were back then. And if you rate a game mainly on the graphics then you obviously don't know how to rate games. The game is brilliant, no question about it.The only bad thing i can come to think of is the time limit of the days in-game. The time goes to quickly (even with the ""Inverted song of time"") and it's hard to enjoy the game fully out without having to feel stressed and that you need to push through the story of the game. I would have liked it if the time would have gone even slower (still with the possibility to speed up or skip time) so you could enjoy the game more and so you wouldn't have to always feel this urge to hurry up. Because right now you have to jump forth and backwards in time a lot and it can be kind of annoying from time to time. But that is the only thing i can judge as negative.I really hope to see a remake of this game in the future with updated graphics and updated in-game details. Maybe with an expanded range of characters and stories to follow.",Poppeloppiluss

23008,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Nintendo64,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Majora's Mask is an amazing game. I can't say it's the best in the series tho, as I'm conflicted between MM and Wind Waker.Majora's Mask to me is like the Morrowind or the Burning Crusade of the Zelda Series. It's new, different, creepy and out of place. The whole world has a ""Depressed"" feeling to it. It can be a pretty dark game. It get's even darker the more you play it and the more you pay attention to the surroundings in the world.The main story is pretty short. There are only four dungeons excluding the Moon ( which is just 1 boss ) in the whole game. Each dungeon however, is pretty great in it's own way. Each dungeon as a sort of gimmick or thing to it. Woodfall doesn't have much of one, but Snowhead revolves around the idea of a controlable platform in the main room. Lower or Higher the platform to get into different areas.Great Bay, while water temples are usually hated, is a pretty ok dungeon. It revolves around changing the water flow to unlock certain areas.The most amazing of the four tho, is Stone Tower. It has a pretty epic idea of climbing a massive tower to get into it. Halfway through tho, you will be able to literally flip the temple upside down to access chests and doors that were previously upside down to begin with. It's pretty amazing as the developers had to design a dungeon to work both right-side up and up-side down at the same time.The reason the game has a lack of dungeons compared to other games in the series, is the fact there are MANY side-quests. In fact I'd say that 30% of your play time contributes to the Main-Quest and 70% to Side-Quests. Best of all is the Side-Quests let you learn more about the world, and how everyone has been effected by current events.You're probably wondering if I think it's better than Ocarina of Time/Master Quest or not. In my opinion, it's much better than OoT.Overall tho, if you've already played OoT and would like a similar game to play, Majora's Mask will feel like an expansion to OoT. I would recommend it if you're looking for that sort of thing. MM runs in the same engine as OoT with a few minor modifications. It uses the N64 Expansion Pack. It uses the Expansion Pack to display Motion-Blur effects.",ultimadwarf

Majora's Mask is definitely a step in a different direction in terms of a traditional Zelda game. Fortunately, this is a good thing, as a simple enough initial story involving the saving of the world from doom in a span of 3 days, is superseded by a vast array of stories of the characters all over the game. These stories really define the mood of Majora's Mask, and make this game the most story involved Zelda yet. This game is definitely weird though, probably the most unusual Zelda game ever. Although there are only 4 dungeons, they are expertly designed and clever. The gameplay is tweaked in Majora's Mask, as you use masks to complete tasks, overcome obstacles and defeat enemies.

Saying that, im not hating on Oot, i still think it is an amazing game. Firstly, lets start with the map, in Oot, you are given a huge map, probably 60% of this map has nothing on it, and when you want to go to Gerudo Valley, you have to trek it all the way from Hyrule to get there. On MM the map is filled with side quests and various other places to visit. Secondly, the characters, in Oot the characters are very unique and have their own personalities. But i cant help but love the fact that in MM each person has their own daily routines of the 3 days, it just adds a world more character to them. Also there were alot more sidequests in MM as there were various mask to collect. Lastly, i dont know why people hate that its timed so much, i think it adds a whole lot more depth to the game. Oh yeah and to reset the time you just play a song, takes like 10 seconds, retard.",Andrevv14

It's a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time so unlike most Zelda games your actually playing as the same Link (the main character of all Zelda games), the story has nothing to do with Ganon, Princess Zelda, or the Tri-Force, and It's focus this time is more on time and side quests than any other entry. In this game you have three days to save the world, and you can do this by rewinding, slowing, and fast-forwarding time. When you first start the game it feels like it's going to be a short experience because there are only a few locations and only four main dungeons, and maybe do to this they decided to up the difficulty, but once you get into it you'll begin to see just how big this game is. It's the most challenging Zelda game I've played, but the game comes packed with 24 masks, most of which are collected by helping out the locals, to help you out. All of the masks have their own abilities, some more useful than others, and if you collect them all you get your hands on one of the coolest items of any Zelda game (that I highly recommend you do to, because it makes the last boss soooo much easier).

Honestly im hard to come up with criticism for this game. This may sound weird but the best part seemed to be the fact it wasent as sucessful as oot. You see, oot was remade multiple times, and became a cheat sheet for the rest of the zelda games, but majoras mask was not, meening it is an original title that is still fun. The difficulty is one of my favorite parts of this game though, which seemed to be scrapped in every other zelda game. not puzzle dificulty, just difficulty. The 3rd boss for example is just about impossible, and is something you would never find in wind waker, which seemed about as hard as slicing a loaf of bread. However, the best part about this game might just be the underlining tone. The game seems to get to you, and sometimes makes you wonder if the world is worth saving, and keeps making you 2nd think if the main bad guys is evil or just being controlled. The 5 sections representing the 5 stages of loss is a nice touch, and really helps the games theme. Overall, even on nowadays standard majoras mask is amazing, and should defiinently be played. if none of this was enough, u get fierce deity link. best reward in any game ever",cc742

The sequel to Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, is a game I've wanted to play for a long time. I always was the game at the store, but I always thought it was simply a remake of Ocarina....I couldn't have been more wrong. This game is a tension driver as your world is about to end and you must find all the missing masks, armed with only you sword, shield, and Ocarina as the only things keeping the moon at bay from destroying the planet and saving the world from a mad orphan. Majora's Mask has taken possession of the Skull Kid and even Link isn't strong enough to stop him alone. Getting to each of the 4 dungeons is in itself, a challenge. The whole world is almost as big as Ocarina's world, but your seriously more restricted this time in the game. The only way to progress through the strory is collect all the masks of power to find a way to stop the Suicidal moon. The game changer here is that you only have 3 Days to do it and with that moon hangin over your head literally all the time, you can't help but feel uneasy when it comes ever closer to your demise. The focus lies primarily on side quests, but that is anything but a bad thing. These quests all have their little personal stories and make you really feel for the sorrow of the people of Termina. Plus all thes stories intertwine with the main conflict and its really interesting to see it all come together in the end. This is a depressing game and while you are driven to save as many people as possible, you must admit to yourself that you can't save them all and thats hard truth you must accept. The challenge in this game is unbelievable so don't be surprised to find yourself staring time all over again before you can take another crack at it. The use of masks is also an awesome change of things and you really have to think out of the box when using them. The ultimate mask Fierce Diety, is also a very important item to use for the final boss since this has to be one of the hardest final bosses I've ever played against.

The three-day mechanic is integral to the story in that it allows for the characters to be develop and their paths to cross in such a way that the story develops WITHOUT it being too overwhelming (more than three days would have been too overwhelming).A point-by-point breakdown:- Definitely the hardest in the series, for veteran Zelda fans- AMAZING dungeon design, by far the best in the series- Large, lush overworld to explore- Amazing soundtrack- A genuinely emotional experience if you pay attention to the plot at all- Countless mini-dungeons to explore to supplement the four main dungeons- Feel like a badass running around as Fierce Diety- Did I mention how freaking cool the Stone Tower Temple is?- You should get this game right now, get it for 3DS if you can, otherwise, install Project64 and play it via emulator- Don't listen to the haters, these are people who don't understand that this game is INTENDED to be a story-driven experience.",Zenpai
23052,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Nintendo64,10,"Whenever people bring up the topic of the best zelda games, the one's that hear typically brought up would be ocarina of time, a link to the past, or wind waker. However, at least in my eyes, those games do not even touch the masterpiece known as Majora's Mask.

However, at least in my eyes, those games do not even touch the masterpiece known as Majora's Mask. I don't even know where to begin with this one, well, maybe I could begin by talking about how it is the most unique and fun zelda game to play by far. This was the second zelda game to not take place in hyrule, instead it takes place in a world known as termina, where link accidentally got himself sent to while trying to retrieve his stolen horse and ocarina. Everything about termina eliminates anything you new about zelda games before: no hyrule, no zelda, no ganon, no master sword, and no triforce. With all of this, it may seem as though it wouldn't feel like a zelda game, but that's not the case at all.Throughout the game, link is helping a man known as the happy mask salesman to retrieve his stolen mask known as Majora's mask, and he makes it clear that you must retrieve it within three days, as he is a busy man and can't stay around for long. At first, it just seems like a fetch quest you must finish quickly so he can leave on time, but eventually you will realize this three day time limit is much darker than you could have ever imagined. I won't go any further in depth than that as you should really play the story to experience it for yourself, and let me tell you, it is one of the best experiences and best stories you will ever play through in a zelda game.Speaking of the three day time limit being dark, everything about this entire game is dark. This is the one aspect everyone knows about majora's mask, and it really delivers in that department. Every character in the game is being tortured by something terrifiying, and they all are unsure of what they should do. Some cower in fear, others refuse to leave because of uncertainty, some even accept their fate, and there are those that are still in denial. What does all of this mean? Play the game, you will find out all about its true darkness.If there is one thing about this game that is really important, it's the gameplay. This game is so much fun to play thanks to what is the greatest mechanic of any zelda game: the masks. These provide for some really awesome gameplay, as you can transform into a zora, be able to run much faster, talk to animals or the dead, or even become a super powered ultra deity. With these, the dungeons become so much fun to play through, and even platforming comes into play at certain times, which is just another reason for why I love the masks.The final aspect I will talk about is the most controversial one of all: the three day time limit. This is the aspect that turns many gamers away from this game, as they did not like the idea of playing under a time limit. But what do I'd think about it? I LOVE it. If it weren't in the game, it would be something completely different. With time always running out, everything in termina changes, whether it is the way the characters act or the moon getting much closer, it really makes the whole game feel alive. Also, needless to say, the period known as the final six hours is my favorite moment in video game history. Why is that? Well, once again, you should play the game and find out.Honestly, I could go on forever about how amazing this game is, but I think I should just end it with this final statement. Majora's Mask is not only the greatest zelda game, but is one of the greatest video games ever made. It incorporates all that I love about video games, which is just why I love it so much.",Rstiles7

Under this time constraint, he created The Legend Of Zelda Majora's Mask. The game follows events of Young Link after the end of Ocarina Of Time. After successfully saving the world, Navi parted ways with Link for unknown reasons. This sets up the reason for his departure from Hyrule some months after warning Zelda about Ganondorf.  Searching for his friend,  Link finds himself in the lost woods where he gets robbed by skull kid.  He follows skull kid to a point where he can confront him but skull kid turns him into a deku scrub. Leaving his follower Tatl, she joins you after apologizing. Continuing to follow skull kid, Link meets the Happy Mask Salesman who tells him the mask skull kid has on is one that contains great evil and he needs link to take back the mask. At some later point you confront skull kid once again but its not looking so good as he is about to drop the moon on the world. Skull Kids follower Tael, mentions that there are 4 people across the map and asks Link to bring them here as skull kid hits him. Link hits skull kid and causes him to drop the ocarina. Using the ocarina, he goes back into time 3 days before.  Notcing everything back to the same they go back to Happy Mask Salesman where he teaches the song of healing. Link is then turned back to normal where he sets out on his journey to visit the 4 areas Tael mentioned and prevent the moon from crashing.Gameplay.In terms of fighting and items, its pretty much ocarina of time.There is a 3 day cycle where if all 3 days end, the game ends as you failed to save it. The thing is, you arent supposed to do everything in one 3 day cycle. Each area should take about 2 days to complete if you are just doing the important story part. You just reset the days after every dungeon by playing the song of time. Everything can pretty much be done at your own pace as long as you dont fail to reset the clock. What i mean by this is you can spend 3 days doing side quest, finding bottles, finding mask, or beating a dungeon.Abilities.Link gets a ton of equipment and even gets more than 2 swords unlike Ocarina of time.The juicy part is the mask. There is 4 main mask (one gotten at the end) and 20 other mask. The 4 main mask give link new fighting styles, abilities, and helps progress in story. The other masks all have there purposes too for side quest.Music:The soundtrack for this game is pretty awesome. Even borrows some music from ocarina of time.Characters.The characters in majoras mask are familiar faces from ocarina of time with a twist. They usually have some lore to go behind them to differentiate them from their parallel ocarina counterpart.  They also have their own original characters such as Kafei which also has good lore. The characters are pretty enjoyable.Summary:Majora's Mask is truly a masterpiece. From its tone that doesnt try to hard to  be dark to its variety of play styles, this game takes what Ocarina Of Time did and does it better while applying its own flare to it. 10/10.",SnappyReview

23058,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Nintendo64,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        In many ways this game is a definite improvement upon Ocarina of Time, because, though it is much shorter, there is a much greater reason to actually go around and explore, while in Ocarina of Time it was more like a luxury. The story is much darker and can even be disturbing. The maniacal, and somewhat sadistic villain in this one leaves your character in a world doomed to be destroyed by a grotesque moon, and throughout the game you have to find a way to prevent that moon from dropping - which you have three days to do. Time travel is, like in Ocarina of Time, heavily incorporated and from the beginning you know you can't accomplish what you can in 3 days, so you rely on your Ocarina in this more than you do in the previous game. Another improvement is that the new fairy, Tatl, is far less annoying and has more personality than Navi ever had. The game, like OOT, has its own lore, and though it can be related to OOT, it is also extremely different because it takes place in another universe or dimension (or whatever you want to call it). You can discover more about the world though the side-quests and exploration - by talking to others. In this game, many of the characters, unlike in OOT, will say different things to you after you've talked to them multiple times. The only way to really hear what they say again is to go back in time and start the 3 day cycle again, otherwise, unless it's really important info, they won't repeat it. You can affect just everyone's future in this, and that's probably one of the most well-thought out parts of this game. During the Kafei Quest, you can end up with so many outcomes, it's ridiculous - most of which are very sad, and only one is happy, but still is followed by inevitable sadness. Also this game is very surreal through its visuals and its levels, and also the fact that you can loop things over and over again adds to this effect. The levels are also constructed amazingly, and, as a player, it is hard to lose interest, and the puzzles are also improved upon from OOT. This game is perfect in its own way, and therefore is definitely worth at least trying.",doodlerman

I could get through them, but they were hard! But when I discovered the song of soaring, I was fine for a while. It was nice of the developers to offer me a challenge. Because back then, YouTube didn't exist so I couldn't look at a walk-through and cheat the right way. I had to figure out everything on my own, and all of this on the shoulders of a nine-year old was a little sadistic. But I eventually did get through the entire game 100%! This game, I'm glad to say is a great sequel to a great game series. I only have one complaint, looking back now, I don't like how it was so short! Beat this guy, beat this guy, beat this guy, beat this guy, and now to the final boss. Just too short! But other than that, it's one of my favorite games of my childhood.

The hype was high expectations when released as people had high hopes for this game being based off the well know Ocarina of time. The main result for this I believe is the fact that the game play is so different compared to previous Zelda games. It was new and scary because people didn't understand just how it worked and I admit some puzzles can be rather difficult but not impossible. The game presents a more dark story line compared to the typical Save the princess and the world I find it was rather refreshing not to mention the mask concept changing things up giving you various abilities. However I believe when I say this genuinely with passion for the Zelda series that some games had it's ups and downs some where appealing than others but I think people where to quick to judge this game. Those whom have only played Ocarina of time and tried Majora's mask have yet to try the many other classic games in the series. I admit some Zelda games I wouldn't think of playing a second time such as the Zelda game that allowed you to play as Princess Zelda... but even so it doesn't make it horrid  just because it wasn't as smooth as the other games before and after it's time. Although if the story line did not appeal to ones interest I understand we all have various tastes but if one where to merely judge upon its game play after only  trying the game for maybe an hour more or less then perhaps they shouldn't be ones to judge if they've never beaten the game to begin with. Also if people judging the graphics.. and random aspects of the game.. For it's time the graphics where good this is an old game you can't compare games like this to games more up to date like the new FPS or Final Fantasy game or whatever you wish to compare it to.  As for the random aspects that make people feel un easy a lot of games have these sort of qualities such as psychonauts this game was under appreciated but the story line and game play was wonderful but because it was so different and random compared to most games people where turned off from it.

The game seems to be the only Zelda game which steps away from the cliche Gannon-Zelda ordeal. Not only does it NOT involve those characters, but it brings to life creatures that normally would be considered side-jobs. The temples were unique. The temples felt nothing like the previous Ocarina temples. The bosses were different in appearance and fight. The temples, though there only being four, were extreme time consumers. I could find myself on the verge on the three-day limit still trying to complete Stone Tower. Want to step away from the original plot and experience Zelda in a new, more haunting form? Check out Majora's mask, it will leave you actually feeling sympathy and remorse for the sobbing, pitiful characters as they mourn over their pending doom.",Kelly

It makes you think if the out-world design could had also been better with some more time in the oven. Dont get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the out-world design, it rivals this of Oot, but you cant stop thinking that the Giant looming Cactai  looking structure in the horizon just looks out of place and weird. This is a game I don't know what to rate, on one hand it surpasses Oot which would make it a perfect 10 but on the other-hand, the lack of polish and strange design design and reused assets clearly shout  ""this game should had been in the oven a bit more"". 9/10",Nilaul

The fact that they reused everything from OoT, all those masks that barely even change the gameplay, and the fact that Nintendo charges full price for this game. Basically, don't buy this game.

Pretty much everything about it is worse than The Ocarina of Time. Don't get me wrong though, it's not a bad game and I am comparing it to the greatest game ever made. I just really don't understand how anyone can say this game is the better of the two.I'll admit that there are a slack handful of improvements, but only to basic mechanics such as changing your items mid conversation. However, the story, characters, music i.e. everything important is worse, and I don't mean slightly, I mean they really did slap this game together.*SPOILER [start]*If you could disable the time limit in the game altogether, you could probably complete the game at a leisurely pace in 10-15 hours. I recently watched my friend play The Ocarina of Time for the first time and it took him 120 hours.

The story is also excellent, it's dark, melancholic and sometimes depressing. A nice change from the usual Zelda storyline. The soundtrack is also excellent, with the best song being without a doubt the song of healing. The boss fights were mostly disappointing, the only one I liked was Goht (that was awesome), the other boss fights and dungeons are easily forgettable. This game isn't in my top 5 Zelda games, I largely prefer Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword, but Majoras's mask is still a good game.

Characters like the Happy Mask Salesman and the children in the moon are fantastic, and help to expand on the ambiguous nature of the game.

Better than anything that the current-gen systems can dish out, better than Halo, better than anything. It is the definitive platformer. The graphics are beautiful, the levels have incredible depth, and the sheer length of the game makes it an absolute classic. The replay value is relatively high. And it is hard to find all 120 of those stars. In fact, if you were devoted enough to getting a single star which has eluded you, it is possible to unwittingly spend up to an hour or more chasing that one star. The game has the ability to make one obsess over it. The only flaw this game has is the wacky camera. May Super Mario 64 live on forever, and may it never be forgotten.",CharlieW.

44084,Super Mario 64,Nintendo64,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Have you ever played a game that is  so darn fun that  you can't put it down, even if you 100% complete all save files? This is that game. If I was forced to pick one flaw it would be the storyline, which is barely flawed anyway! You play as Mario, the famous plumber, rendered for the first time in history in polygons. Sure, the storyline is the same old ""Bowser captures princess, Mario duffs up Bowser, everyone lives happily ever after"" shtick, but this entry throws in paintings and Power Stars into the mix. Bowser owns dimensions contained in paintings that are a danger to Mario, hindering him on his quest. in the paintings you will find the humorously named Power Stars. Power Stars are like keys to doors, because essentially the more Power Stars you have, the more doors you can enter, and entering doors allows you to quest for more Powers Stars. It's a vicious cycle, but you want to get sucked in. Which other video game rewards you with a giant's step towards 100% completion for collecting 100 gold coins? On the topic of coins, a gold coin (canonically named a yellow coin) is worth one buck, a red one two, and blue a whopping five. Collecting eight red coins in a single course rewards you with a-you guessed it-Power Star.  The game's graphics were amazing in its time, and to some still are. We're talking about one of the first games to use mainly polygons here. One of the first games to use polygons, and maybe the best.  The sound is epic, with a range of tunes going from genuinely day-improving to genuinely scary. Even when you've got all 120 Power Stars (and shed a tear or sixteen), there's still fun to be had. In the Princess' castle grounds, there is a cannon only activated when you have 120 stars that will blast you to the castle roof where you'll find (spoiler) old comrade Yoshi, who will give you 100 lives and an improved triple jump power! (spoiler end) And on the Internet you may encounter sites that gives suggestions of activities to do in the game that are meant to be done after 100% completion! So, even after beating the final boss and collecting all 120 Power Stars, there's still much fun to be had.One of the best games ever.",LordFawful

44187,Super Mario 64,Nintendo64,9,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        While I don't care for this game as much as some people I will admit that I have always enjoyed Mario's first 3D Platformer; Super Mario 64. I do have some nostalgia from this game even though I didn't grow up playing that many video games, I just remember playing this game at a friend's house and I very much enjoyed it. So I eventually got my own copy of the game on the Wii Virtual Console later on in my life and when I got a used N64, I got the original SM64 cart as well, and I still enjoy the game today. The gameplay is solid, there are many different levels with very fun stars to collect, one thing though is that it the level themes may get repetitive; for example early on in the game you will find the level Cool, Cool Mountain which is a snow themed level, but later on in the game you find Snowman's Land; while the levels had their differences, I kind of wished for more diversity in themes, but maybe I shouldn't criticize that since the game may have have some limitations in being made. The bosses are okay, however I do think the final boss against Bowser is cool. I also like Mario's new abilities like being able to kick and ground-pound. Overall Super Mario 64 is a classic; while I do like Sunshine and the Galaxy games better, every gamer should play this.",DrewtheDude85

That said however, I think the game is largely overrated beyond belief.

That said however, I think the game is largely overrated beyond belief. Even on its own console, Donkey Kong 64, Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie far out shine it. The game music is bland and repetitive, the bosses suck, the story comes off as less interesting than other Mario games (although to be fair, most Mario games don't really have a story anyway) some of levels are flat out bad, and the camera is rather annoying (although it isn't broken) and just doesn't really have the charm that many other 3D platformers have. This is not to say the game is bad, certainly it isn't, it is a good game. Some levels are great, like Bob-omb Battlefield and Whomp's Fortress, controls are decent, enemy variety is decent, and the controls are good, and certainly outshine its early 3D rivals Croc and Bubsy. Interestingly, the people that made Croc, Argonaut Games, are the people that likely made Super Mario 64 a success, because they claim they had originally proposed ideas to Nintendo to create a 3D Mario and later a 3D Yoshi racing game to Nintendo, but Nintendo rejected and ignored these ideas; to this this day, they claim Nintendo stole their ideas and revolutionary 3D hardware to make Super Mario 64, which I'm inclined to believe is true. But anyway, back to the review. Overall, the game is good, but it isn't the greatest platformer out there, it isn't the best 3D platformer for the Nintendo 64, it isn't the best 3D platformer  for the Mario series, and it certainly isn't the best in the genre of 3D platformers.

Every stars I manage to earn adds even more enthusiasm in obtaining all of them.

To begin, let's start with the presentation, graphics and audio. The graphics are very good for n64. The contrast of the 2D characters with the 3D background still holds up today.The music is almost flawless. The title screen music gives the player a sense of fun urgency to begin the adventure, the battle themes are classic, and the remaining themes are all conducted perfectly, fitting their respective environments.The story appears to be typical of a mario game as bowser steals peach and mario must rescue her. However, Paper Mario's story shines in its details. The npcs of the game are given a great amount of characterization, which this creates a sense of connectivity within the game that is not seen in many other mario games. The story is revealed in storybook fashion, with each world being called a chapter instead. Each chapter is completely different from the previous, keeping the game fresh by introducing new environments, objectives, puzzles, characters, and gameplay. After each chapter, you get to see what peach is up to. This is the worst part of the game, as you have to control kidnapped peach in an attempt to find out information to get relayed to mario. However, this is an interesting concept that would get expanded on in the next 2 paper mario games.Onto the actual gameplay elements: As you progress in the game, you pick up several party members. These party members are needed for puzzles and assist you in battle. The battles are turn based, yet are interactive, as you can perform action commands to do more damage or block attacks, much like in mario rpg. As you progress, you get more attacks, upgrades, badges, and items that add an amazing amount of depth and strategy to the game. You can level up if you get enough battle experience. As a kid I didn't know any better but to always increase my heart points (health) rather than allocating it between flower points and badge points. The bosses all bring something new to the table, and you must figure out a strategy to beat each one. Other gameplay elements include solving well thought out puzzles that progressively get more rewarding and challenging, collecting star pieces to get new badges, and exploring the vast maze of the toad town tunnels. Yeah, so in summary, the battle system is pretty amazing and deep and tops off an almost flawless game.",jamba24

It is a Nintendo classic afterAfter the controversial announcement of Color Splash last year, a lot of people started to complain about the series’ new direction and compare it to the first Paper Mario games. Because of that reason, I watched a good number of videos from Nintendo-themed channels talking about how great the original Paper Mario is. So I finally decided to give it a try. It is a Nintendo classic after all, so I couldn’t skip it for too long being a Nintendo fan.My experience with Paper Mario was mostly a positive one. The game offers a pretty fun combat system and a clear structure of objectives: Bowser has imprisoned the 7 Star Spirits in different parts of the Mushroom Kingdom and it is up to Mario to rescue them one by one. Each of the ‘Chapters’, as they are called, is a little plot on its own. The overall story could very well be a part of a children’s book. Bowser is a really funny antagonist. The different regions in the map all felt very lively and varied, especially Toad Town.All of the chapters are mostly fun to play through (Chapter 7 is probably my favorite), and the battle system is simple yet effective. But Paper Mario often felt a bit repetitive to me, especially the combat.Another problem I have with this game is the fact that in most JRPGs, the game is driven by a strong and interesting storyline. Paper Mario’s storyline isn’t strong nor interesting. Basically, no level of seriousness or actual drama is allowed in this game. Everything is always goofy and innocent, and this has a positive side and a negative side. The positive side is that it allows for a lighthearted and humorous game experience.  The negative side is that there’s no engaging story to motivate you to keep playing, like in most other JRPGs.As a result, I often found myself with no reason to continue playing other than the desire of just completing the game. But on the other hand, the gameplay was good enough to keep me going.The art style was very unique for the time, and the soundtrack is just lovely. The entire aesthetic design manages to convey the lighthearted and happy nature of the game perfectly, and it is probably my favorite aspect of this Paper Mario.Even though I love Nintendo’s classics, and this is a very Nintendo-feeling game, I honestly can’t see what most of the people see in this game to call it a masterpiece. I’ll remember Paper Mario as a little gem filled with humor, wacky and memorable characters, and a great art direction (soundtrack and visuals), that offer a lighthearted and colorful experience, but nothing more than that.Score: 8.3",luisflopez

I also loved the fact that each partner had it's own ability, making it more variable instead of using the same attacks over and over again, it was simply a genius idea, congratulations on that!Great job with this game!

However, a large range of badges with different effects compensates for this. As Mario levels up, you can boost one of three attributes at a time HP (health points), FP (flower points for using special moves) and BP (badge points which indicate the number of slots available for a badge).Presentation-wise, it looks quite amazing for a Nintendo 64 title. The paper aesthetic is not so much as realized here as in future entries, but is still appealing in its simplicity. Music is catchy and at times atmospheric and the dialogue, like all Mario RPGs, is quite humorous.The Nintendo 64 did not boast as many RPGs as it did 3D platformers, and this particular RPG does have elements from platformers integrated in the overworld and dungeons. Some of the puzzles are straightforward, and some fetch quests can be frustrating (particularly in the flower fields) but overall, it is a charming game.This is a great game and is certainly worth the time, but the definitive Paper Mario experience is in the next entry on the GameCube.",smeargle05

The graphics are gorgeous for a N64 game, giving the game a visual style reminiscent of a pop-up book with flat characters, 3D environments and painted backgrounds.

The characters are lively and varied, and even many of the minor characters have their own names, personalities and designs. The battle system is a fun, more involved take on turn-based battles that incorporates action commands for potential bonus damage or additional effects, strengthened by the ability to somewhat customize your stats and available moves through equippable badges and partners with their own unique abilities (including on the field, where using your partners' abilities is key to solving certain puzzles). The only reason this game doesn't get a perfect score from me is because it's a little slow to get going, as the early parts of the game drag a bit and it takes some time to gain the ability to use action commands.

58087,Paper Mario,Nintendo64,6,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        I grew up with Super Mario RPG on this SNES, and had wanted to play Paper Mario back when it was still Super Mario RPG 2 in development. So when I bought a Wii, this was the first game I downloaded. Did I enjoy the game? Yes and no.Starting with the good points. - There is a LOT to see and do in the game, and since most of the backtracking can be avoided it doesn't get old quickly, which I can really appreciate.- The character and enemy design is fairly decent. There's not a great deal of variety in either, but their graphics still look crisp for being 11 years old (though the 3D parts still look dated)- There's a lot of customizing to be done with badges, which does present a bit of thought provoking when you have to choose what will be good in the upcoming battles.- Humor is everywhere in the game. Most of it was too cheesy for me, but there were some I really enjoyed, like Whacka the mole.- The end credits were perfect, doing another march as in Super Mario RPG. Couldn't have done them better.Andddd the bad.- The story. For an RPG, they really didn't try too hard to make a decent storyline, just the same ""Bowser kidnaps Peach"" plot that they've reused dozens of times since 1985. - Though there are a lot of badge options, the low maximum for badge number really limits the usefulness. After equipping the 3 ""Attack/Defense Plus"" badges, you're down to only 12 to play with. I found the most effective build was to boost your normal attacking/defending skills, which really only gave you room for 1 special attack.- Whoever did the work on names really needed a second opinion. All of the toad names were mind numbingly terrible puns, like Tayse T. the cook, Russ T. the librarian, and Dain T.  Gah.- The battle system needed a lot of polish. It still uses the same basic system from Super Mario RPG but was simplified at just about every turn. No armor and 2 weapons to choose from in the entire game made shops mostly invalidated. The enemy queue system meant that you were mostly stuck attacking whoever was closest first, unless you invested heavily in mostly useless badges. The experience system was frustrating at best, seeing as level-ups quickly made most battles pointless, as no experience would be awarded.- Mario's secondary characters were mostly useless. Goombario, Watt and Bombette would last you the entire game. The others were generally unimpressive in battle and really only served for non-combat abilities.- Peach's scenes were the worst by far. She couldn't take any real actions (no jumping or attacking) and it quickly became repetitive, as she could even take a ""secret"" passageway into Bowser's room with him IN THERE, and still get to try it again next time. Baffling. The cake making was miserable.- The arguing with Square got a lot of the more nostalgic points removed from the game (at least for me), with Star Hill becoming Shooting Star Point, and even ""Time Hits"" became ""Action Commands"". I would have loved to see Mallow in the game, but that's life.- No real mini-games to speak of. Unless you want to count the letter delivering. Which I don't.In the end, Paper Mario was a serviceable RPG. Too simplistic to really be called amazing, but it was decent. And it's hard to fault the game too much, because it's a non Squaresoft, non-Pokemon RPG. At least they tried. But I doubt I'd play it a second time through.",forestofbramble

Surprisingly the game was incredible as it introduced many incredible staples and prowess in the RPG genre. I remember playing this game since I was a kid and it is still making such an impact today. The game has such a nostalgic and childish atmosphere that you can't help but feel like your going through memory lane as you play. And if you don't crack one smile during this whole game....your dead inside. From the very beggining you find the same old Bowser kidnaps Peach storyline far more meaningful in this game than most other Mario games. Not just because their is a little more in depth look at the story, but the new locations, and characters you see along the way. And the unique obstacles you will have overcome to find the seven star sages. The game plays great in the RPG department, as it is easy to learn and master once you get the hang of timing your attacks perfectly. Badges only make the fights more interesting as you learn new techniques and utilize their full potential. The variety in this game is outstanding and you will no doubt run into a few skirmishes here and there, especially if you get too  and end up accepting a challenge from some other  rival........in which you learn the true limits of your own strength. While their are many easy baddies here in this game, I wouldn't really call this game easy. The puzzles can easily turn devious on you and their are rivals that will give you a hard time. Still the bosses are usually easy one you figure their weaknesses  but they become essential to your survival if you just try the same old tactic just like any other baddie. The partners are charming and really make the game that much more enjoyable in and out of battle. Following you like a pokemon, each partner has a unique ability that you will likely have fun using throughout the game. Like I said before this game is memorable, and will really make you look at Mario in a different light. There are so many things to do even after you defeat Bowser.....even though you will always start back at you last checkpoint after the credits roll. Making recipes, delivering letters, finding special  items, and even challenging against a kung fu master who's stronger than Bowser himself! Like I said this game is truly enjoyable and quite a memorable experience. The ending still makes me shed tear as it really brings you back.

The games typically are not very story heavy and the gameplay is basic but fun.  However, for those looking for a little bit more substance in your Mario games, Mario has a handful of role playing games (RPGs) that have unique gameplay and an interesting story.  The first Mario RPG was Super Mario RPG for the SNES and it was a decent game.  However, it was Paper Mario for the N64 that perfected the Mario RPG formula.  The gameplay for most of the Mario RPGs involve the action command system.  This means the battles are turn based but to deal damage, the player must input a certain button command.  This system works tremendously in Paper Mario.  The commands work perfectly and you can defend when the enemy attacks by using these button commands.  The Mario RPGs also have ability points called Flower Points (FP).  By spending FP you can use certain abilities such as a more powerful jump or a partners special ability.  In Paper Mario you have one partner by your side at all times and you can always switch them out with another partner.  Each partner has there own special trait.  For example, the partner Parakarry can fly Mario across gaps outside of battle and attacks using flight related attacks in battle.  Outside of battle, you will be solving puzzles and platforming.  One of the best parts about the game are the boss battles.  The bosses always have something to do with each chapter of the game your in.  For example, chapter 7 is a chapter focused on ice.  The boss of chapter 7 is Crystal King and uses ice based attacks.  Because of there relations to the chapter, it is fun to figure out what there weakness (i.e. Crystal King is weak to heat attacks).  The gameplay would be improved upon in each of the sequels to Paper Mario, specifically Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.  The story is your basic Bowser kidnaps Peach scenario.  However, the characters are now fleshed out, especially Bowser.  Bowser now feels incredibly threatening compared to his former interpretations.  The graphics are good.  Everything is designed to look like it came out of a pop up book  The only problem is that the concept is not used to its fullest potential.  Overall, the main problem with the game is that it is out-shined by its sequels, specifically Super Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.

58113,Paper Mario,Nintendo64,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        Released for the Nintendo 64 on japanese markets in august 2000, Paper Mario was the indirect follow up to Squaresoft's 1996 SNES hit ""Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars"". Even though it came out during the end of the N64's life span, the game is still considered a classic by Nintendo fans and JRPG enthusiasts alike.The most unique aspect of the game is, funnily enough,  its art style. Almost everything, as you probably already guessed by this point, is made out of paper with the final product being reminiscent of one of those pop-up books we used to love so much during our childhood. Though the limitations of the N64 can make the game look a bit dated here and there, it is hard to deny that Paper Mario would have such a special charm to it had the developers opted for the more grounded visuals of the Square's original game.But looking pretty can only do so much for RPG, so let's get down to the gameplay. Being true to Mario's side-scrolling roots, the game combines platforming, puzzle solving and exploration with traditional but somewhat distinct JRPG elements in order to create a memorable and yet refreshing experience. The combat differs a bit from your typical Final Fantasy by having optional inputs the player can perform in order to enhance the effect of an attack. For instance, if the A button is pressed just before Mario lands on an enemy the plumber will do an extra jump, adding a small but significant amount of damage. Unfortunately this is not the only way in which the combat is unique. For some god forsaken reason your party members do not have a health bar, meaning you can not use them as a way to protect the main character when he's low on HP, something that was thankfully fixed in the GameCube sequel.The writing is another aspect that should be examined closely. Even though the game's main story follow the exact same structure of the series, with the princess being kidnapped by Bowser and Mario being assigned to rescue her, there is still a good deal of personality that is simply not present in the italian's more traditional adventures. An unique sense of humor appropriately complements the happy and upbeat vibe conveyed by the art style music, and while most party members are not that memorable compared to the ones in The Thousand-Year Door, the attempt to flesh out the relationship between Bowser and Peach (as well as their individual personalities) was definitely a welcome touch. The sequel that stood out for me the most was when the princess was invited by Bowser's minions to participate in quiz game.Paper Mario is a nice twist on the typical JRPG formula. Instead of trying to tell us an epic story about about a bunch of heroes trying to save the world from a generic power-hungry god, it just wants us to laugh and have a good time. It sacrifices the traditional grinding for the sake of offering a more family friendly experience, while also pleasing the more hardcore audience by borrowing elements from other genres such as platforming and adventure. Despite of what your relationship with electronic games is, Paper Mario is guaranteed to offer you an extremely unique experience that you are unlikely to find in other RPGs.",Flipmails

Rareware did a magnificent job creating these humorous characters that quickly became charming and fun throughout the game. The presentation in visuals is outstanding for a 1998 game on the N64 and the overall game soundtrack is extremely catchy to match the Banjo universe perfectly. Like Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie is one of those titles you do not know when to put the controller down. The game is entirely fun with solid puzzle challenges and great exploration through each and every location. However, the game can be really nerve wrecking at times if you plan to complete the game at 100% or playing later portions of the game such as the final boss with Gruntilda. Believe me, beating her to finish the game is pretty difficult. In results, Banjo-Kazooie is a solid platformer containing jigsaw piece to find and birds to fire eggs out of their butts. I highly recommend anyone to get Banjo-Kazooie to any fans of platforming games or video games in general. It's definitely a game you will not get disappointed with.",TipsyMcBee

They allow you to come back to them and slowly unlock more knowledge about them until you get every puzzle piece and honeycomb imaginable! Discovery is not too cryptic, and the game always gives hints towards what to do, without making it obvious. You really have to think, and that's what I love about this game. The world is full of secrets that have simple puzzles blocking your way to them. When you solve the puzzle, it's so satisfying! Mix that with good platforming, and you have the formula for a great game. However, when I say ""good"" platforming, I mean ""good"" and not ""great"", as the world is more set around problem solving. The graphics are nice and colourful, and the music is catchy. I like the was Banjo controls, and though it's not quite as great as in Sonic Adventure, it's good. One problem however is that occasionally with the way the control is implemented, it can sometimes be frustrating in a part of the level, like in the part of Freezeezy Peak where you have to hit the alligators. it's weirdly non-functional! One of the other few flaws is the generic story, but since the game pays such a small amount of attention to it, it hardly matters.

After that I looked at all three of the games and said too myself, ""Banjo-Kazooie blows Mario 64 out of the water and Zelda OOT out of the water temple (shudders). now I think all three of those games are good it's just that Banjo-Kazooie is a little less linear than Mario 64 because Mario 64 forced the player to do one episode in the level, getting kicked out of the level and having to go back in to play in the same level and Banjo-Kazooie has a original concept of being like a scavenger hunt unlike Zelda OOT which was just like a 3-D Link to the Past. You know what scratch that being Rare's best game, Banjo-Kazooie is the best N64 game of all time. God their is just so many great things about this game other than the ones I motioned earlier; the 9 unique, varied, and most of all huge levels that you don't necessary need a map for like in the sequel which is also a great game, the subtle humor and multiple personalities every character gets, the excellent music by Grant Kirkhope that matches as well as emphasizes on the environments that you are in, and that is just a few of the things that make Banjo-Kazooie a great game.

Graphics (9): For its time Banjo Kazooie offered some of the richest graphics. The world diversity is similar to Mario 64, and in some parts is even more detailed. Sound (7): Some of the environments sound ok but most of the music and noises get repetitive. Gameplay (9): Feels similar to Mario 64 with a little more diversity, being able to play as 2 characters. You will notice the controls are rather responsive. The game-play surprisingly is where this game shines, the world is fun to explore and collect the extras. Endgame: (8) The game will take some time to complete, and there is a lot of secrets to go after. Some sort of multi-player support would have been nice.

It rewardsEasily one of the best platformer games of all time.Banjo Kazooie is an excellent example of a new take on the basic platformer genre that Mario popularized. It has some similarities to Mario 64 but it has its own identity and improves on Mario 64 in most ways. The story is basic but it does a great job of always pulling you forward and making you want to see what is next. It rewards progression in multiple ways and the game gets better and better the further you get. The characters are funny, iconic and memorable. The idea of playing as a bird and bear seems silly but it makes sense in the context of the bizarre cartoony world. The game is challenging but rewarding and the variety of gameplay makes every section a joy to experience. I recommend this game to anyone who loves 3d platformers.The gameplay is easily some of the best on the N64, aside from some camera issues (which was a problem with 64 games in general) almost all the controls are simple and intuitive. The sheer number of moves you can perform stretched the limits of the N64 control to the limit. As you progress through the game you gain new skills at a steady pace and each one is rewarding, allowing you to explore the world more fully.  At the time of its release I can't think of any games that allowed you to do more. You can fly, swim, and transform into many different forms and each one changes gameplay in a meaningful way. The game also does collectibles right. In a lot of games collectibles do little more than act as a way of keeping score or letting you progress but in Banjo Kazooie all of the collecting has an impact on gameplay and the more you collect the more you will be rewarded later in the game. It is the right level of challenge and reward. There aren't many boss battles unfortunately but the final boss is one of the most challenging and entertaining that I have seen in a game. My only major complaint about the gameplay is that the controls are a bit loose, which can make precise movement of the character very frustrating at times.The story is nothing to write home about but it is still better than any Mario story that I can think of. The characters are entertaining and Gruntilda is iconic and hilarious. As the game progresses she continually taunts you and you learn more details from her sister about just how disgusting she is. The story progresses pretty constantly as you make your way through the witches tower and Gruntilda continuously comments on how annoyed she is with your progress. The build up is very satisfying. Most people don't play platformers for the story but it helps to have one that is at least somewhat enjoyable and gives a sense of progress.The world is easily one of the best on the N64. There are 9 main world and a fairly large hub world that connects them all together in a fun way. Gruntila's Lair offers enough of a linear path that it makes climbing the tower satisfying while also providing some options for exploration. The game is mostly linear but because of how worlds are unlocked you don't need to do everything in a specific order. Sometimes if you reach a tough spot it is best to move on and come back when you have upgraded Banjo-Kazooie's  abilities. It offers a great mix of freedom and direction. In terms of the design of each world, every one offers something unique in appearance, gameplay and even character interactions. The character interactions are usually nothing special but there are a few that do enough to make you love or hate the characters you meet in a motivational way. In general the worlds also get progressively better and more challenging which is rewarding. The final world is definitely the most unique and that really made it special.The visuals were definitely some of the best on the N64 and in my opinion it is far more interesting visually than Super Mario 64 was. The soundtrack is not exactly emotionally moving but it is very fun and full of memorable themes. Nearly two decades later I still remember a lot of the music. The sound design isn't as good as a game like Ocarina of Time but it is still some of the best of its time. Sound effects are very effective and mostly appealing, except for when they are intended not to be such as captain blubbers voice.Banjo-Kazooie raised the bar for 3d platformers and even after nearly 20 years I struggle to find games in the genre that are its equal. I tried replaying it on the Xbox in more recent years and it still holds up really well. It is a benchmark game that helped redefine the platformer genre. It has great visuals, amazing gameplay, meaningful collectibles, lots of secrets, dozens of unique ideas, top level production values and a ton of content.I give Banjo Kazooie: 87%Gameplay - 9Story Progression - 6World - 10Uniqueness/Ideas - 9Characters - 7Visual Design - 10Sound Design - 8Length/Amount of Content - 9Immersion - 9X-Factor - 10",artificeprime

It absolutely nuked my expectations! First off, the jokes were hilarious, especially the Great Mighty Poo song! Secondly, the graphics were totally amazing for the time, and did not even require the expansion pak, which is always a bonus. The platforming was perfect and the controls were great as well. The multiplayer is by far one of the best of its console and definitely the best last level of any video game. The worlds and characters were very creative and colorful. The parodies added a special fun twist to it as well. Many people thought it was too immature, but the game was intended to be that way, and that is what makes it a funny adventure. I can only think of three minimal flaws with it. One, the gameplay is rather limited. I can probably beat the game in a week if I played it through again. Two, the chapter ""It's War"" kinda sucked and was impatiently frustrating. Finally three, what is with the price! As of this review, it costs $50! That is how much a new game is today! The main reason it is that high though is because it's relatively rare, (50,000 copies) and it is in very high demand. Despite its price tag, Conker is a must for any Nintendo 64 collection! I really hope they make an amazing sequel, but it seem to go that direction considering the hated remake they made and the ending to this one.",thejonez

And the whole thing was developed by Rare, who had their golden age on the Nintendo 64 and were the very best developer around. So what could go wrong?Turns out, a lot.OK let's start with the positive: This game has got the be the funniest game on the N64. Back in the day when it came out, it was unthinkable to have such a grown-up game with raunchy, adult humor on a Nintendo console. And the whole thing was developed by Rare, who had their golden age on the Nintendo 64 and were the very best developer around. So what could go wrong?Turns out, a lot. I picked this game up again yesterday after not having played it for probably 16 years. It was mentioned in a Youtube Video and I actually had very fond memories of it. So I started playing and was delighted at the humor in the cutscenes, the characters, and the pop culture references, many of which I didn't get back then at age 11 when I first played it.But soon enough, other memories also resurfaced: Unbearable frustration, me throwing my N64 controller across the room and totally freaking out at the game. And now, I can confidently say; that rage was not just me as an 11-year old not having the experience and skill to master a hard game. That rage was completely justified because this game is hard for ALL THE WRONG REASONS.The controls and camera are completely **** You never know if your jumps are gonna land where you want them to, which is the death-sentence for a platforming game. But it's not just platforming, every game mechanic is just complete **** Aiming with the slingshot is completely unintuitive. Underwater levels are hell on earth because you become disoriented within seconds thanks to the lousy camera. You can theoretically control the camera with the C-buttons, but good luck with that!Other mechanics only appear once or at certain times. For example, there are sections where Conker gets drunk, has to piss on certain things/enemies and then sobers up after a while. Then you have to walk to a first aid box and pop an Alka Seltzer before you can move normally again (and return to the beer keg to get drunk again, because you probably have not finished what you need to do in one go-around). My questions: WHY is the first aid box located at the **** other end of the room? WHY the **** does Conker have to walk so unbearably slow when hung-over, sometimes while there are other enemies around, whose attacks you have NO CHANCE of avoiding in this state? WHY THE **** does Conker have to come to a standstill every two meters to puke? Why even have the hung-over state at all if all it does is annoy players and drag the game out?  WHY,WHY,WHY. Why a lot of things. Why is the move set so limited compared to Rare games that came out before, like Banjo-Kazooie? Why do you take Fall damage even from ridiculously low heights? WHY are the mechanics so ****ed, that even though I know exactly what the game wants me to do, I just cannot accomplish it and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong because things just don't work as you would expect?Frankly, the game is just not fun. And like Reggie said: ""If the game's not fun, why bother?"" Which is a downright shame, because the cutscenes (and the characters within them) are A LOT of fun, but the gameplay in between is mediocre at best and unnerving, frustrating, unfair and completely defect at worst.Seems to me like all the resources, ideas and energy were put into the jokes, and the game is just a hastily put-together vehicle for those.If you are like me and you have fond memories of this game and want ro revisit them by digging up your N64 and popping this cartridge in: Don't. Keep your fond memories. Watch a cutscenes supercut on Youtube, but don't give yourself the torture of actually playing this.",B-Bog

But was an offshoot into a Saving Private Ryan spoof necessary for this particular game ?",PaulW

But the game is never as clever or fun as it thinks it is.    Yes, it's different, and it was daring of Nintendo to have an adult game on what was largely considered a kiddie console, but in the end Conker will always be known more for its shock value, than being a great game.

Conker the Squirrel is a brilliant protagonist, despite being an alcoholic, foul mannered, stereotypical and anthropomorphic... squirrel. The voice acting is so terrible, it's brilliant, because it really makes the player laugh out loud from the ridiculous sound and how well it fits in with the humour of the game. Moreover, the bosses are very inventive, and the game has one of the most hilarious and one of the best bosses ever: A giant, British, opera-singing turd! And honestly, the game is packed to the brim with movie references, from the Terminator Haystack, to the Xenomorph fight, you can't get any more vulgarity and hilarity than in this masterpiece, a masterpiece that wasn't commercially successful for 2 reasons: It's meant for an adult audience, which meant limited advertising, and it was released in the N64's last days.

72245,Conker's Bad Fur Day,Nintendo64,8,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        WARNING: THIS GAME HAS BEEN GIVEN AN ""M"" RATING BY THE ESRB. AS A RESULT, IT MAY CONTAIN BLOOD, GORE, SWEARING, VIOLENCE, INNUENDOS AND MORE. NOT FOR ANYONE UNDER 17 YEARS OF AGEIn 2001, before motion control sports and childhood-ruining third installments, Rare was making a killing off of developing games for Nintendo. One of these games released during this time period was Twelve Tales: Conker 64...At least, that was what it was called...in 1998. Now entitled Conker's Bad Fur day, this was a Nintendo 64 game that sold poorly, likely because it released late into the console's life, and other reasons, which I'll get to in a bit. It was one of the last titles Rare developed for a Nintendo console. So is this the last hurrah of a game company as I knew and loved it, or is this literally a Bad Fur Day?One night, Conker is at a bar, intoxicated as you would guess, when he rings up his Lola the Rabbit look-a-like girlfriend Berri. He tells her that he'll be home soon but he goes in the wrong direction, not because he forgot the way but because he's drunk as hell, and ends up in the kingdom of the Panther king. We then see said Panther king drinking milk when his table breaks, spilling his milk. He then orders his local scientist, Professor Von Kriplespac, to fix the table and they devise a plan to capture Conker and use him to hold up the table. The plot is ridiculous and funny...until it becomes 1% less funny when Berri gets kidnapped. Gotta fill the cliché bar, eh guys?This game looks really damn good for an N64 game. Of course the graphics have aged slightly, but it still has a nice look to it. The animations are surprisingly detailed, if a bit stiff, and the environments don't look too shabby. The soundtrack is great. My favorites have to be Windy and Co., Rock Solid, and, of course, The Great Mighty Poo's Opera. What's REALLY impressive is how they fit a busload of voice acting into a cartridge! A CARTRIDGE!!!!The gameplay, however, is what docks this game some points. It's your typical platformer affair. You can run, jump, and kill enemies. There are also some puzzles which are...okay. They are often creative and yield some VERY hilarious results, but they take a large amount of trial and error. The game features an overworld where you can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Yes, in this game, you're main and really only collectable is cash. You can earn cash from beating puzzles or levels. Almost all the levels parody some sort of movie such as Terminator, Terminator 2, Jaws, The Matrix, Saving Privet Ryan, and even Ridley Scott's Alien. The controls work well enough, but jumping is slightly delayed which can often be frustrating. What I REALLY hate is the slowdown. Sometimes, the game can slow down to about 15 to 24 frames per second. Does it ruin the game? No, but once I noticed it, it was hard to un-notice it.Overall, Conker's Bad Fur Day is a DELIGHTFUL platformer. That really stands on its own. While it has some issues, You are almost guaranteed a good time. The original game is somewhat of a rarity, and while there has been a remake for the original Xbox, you're best bet is to play this using the Rare Replay compilation for the Xbox One. jetpacks and Butlers, here we come.",NerdyMayonnaise

The audio was absolutely amazing. Tension when tension was required, and excitement when excitement was required. The only part of this game I didn't particularly enjoy was the storyline. There was simply too many characters to understand what was going on when I was a child. However, I didn't let this bother me. Some levels were incredibly hard (The Sanctuary of Stone and Fire to name just one), however I had good fun giving them a go. I am awaiting the arrival of Rayman 3D on the Nintendo 3DS (which is this game, but on the 3DS). I hope it's just as good and too many things haven't changed, otherwise I may never get another chance to play this game...",MichaelMcKitt

The only flaw in this game are the mini games that are sometimes VERY unfair, but many people fail to realize YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THEM unless it's a mandatory mini game. You see in DK64 some people believe you need to collect all 200 golden bananas to beat the game, hence them believing you have to do all the unfair mini games but thats not the case AT ALL, I beat this game only getting about 145-160 golden bananas, I think you can even get less to beat this game. The graphics are one of the unquestionable absolute best on the N64, better than Banjo Kazooie but not better than Tooies. The multiplayer mode is also a good time(if you have 4 people) where you and you're friends are in 1 of 3 maps seeking each other to murder one another with combat,fruit guns, and grenades. If the one friend gets the heat seeking ammo it's all over(unless you as well have some heat seeking ammo).

Making matters worse is the fact that EACH CHARACTER needs to collect each item to unlock certain features. The game is tedious enough playing just as a single character, but add in the four others and it becomes ridiculous.The music in this game is engaging (the DK Rap might just be the highlight of the whole experience!), but other than that nothing really stands out.

95614,Banjo-Tooie,Nintendo64,10,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        A banjo and a kazoo never sounded betterBanjo-Kazooie was made in 1998 by a game company name Rare. Nintendo, being the Disney of video games, owned Rare. Banjo-Kazooie follows the story of a bear named Banjo and a bird named Kazooie, it was a revolutionary game, so it makes sense that they would soon make a sequel, Banjo-tooie and then even later, a threequel, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts.Banjo-tooie,is like Luigi from the Mario Bros. series. Luigi will forever and always be overhadowed by his older brother Mario. Again, comparatively, Banjo-Kazooie, the game, is Mario. And then you have the weird uncle, Waluigi, or in this case, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and bolts, which was the third game in the series, but nobody likes to talk about them. Banjo-Kazooie (or as we are going to start calling it B-K) was a really good game. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and bolts was an absolutely awful game. And everybody seems to forget the game in between. Banjo-tooie (or B-t for short), and I will be reviewing B-t.Banjo-tooie takes place directly after the events of B-K. In the end of B-K Banjo and Kazooie push grunty off of a tower and she get’s crushed by a rock. We don’t see this of course, the game was rated E. We know this happens though because at the beginning of B-t we meet grunty's sisters. Their names are Mingy and Blobby, you kinda have to wonder what there mother was thinking when she named her daughters. But anyway, Blobby and Mingy use a special gun called the Big-O-Blaster, Or the B.O.B for short. When Grunty rises she remembers she was killed by the bear and bird duo, in her fiery rage she approaches Banjo’s house. Banjo, Kazooie, Mumbo, and Bottles are playing a hilarious game of poker, which I think is a great way of showing the character's personality, Kazooie is a funny, sarcastic character, while Banjo is always the one keeping Kazooie in line, Mumbo is a little bit one dimensional but you can tell he is a good friend, and Bottles is a wimpy friend that is super smart  but he is also super oblivious. I like that they could show all of these characters characteristics in such a short movie clip. Back to the story long story short Grunty uses her magic to blow up banjo’s house. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo all get out quick enough to survive and, short story shorter, poor Bottles is burnt to a crisp. Then starts Banjo, and Kazooie's, and maybe even Mumbo’s, grand adventure to take grunty down. Again.Although the story seems like it was kinda slapped together like a bad sandwich, it really works for the game. You have to be glad that this is not a cliche story where the not so main character get’s captured and you, the hero, go on some perplexing adventure just to save the girl. B-t reminds me of the game “The legend of Zelda: Majora's mask.” In Majora’s mask, Link is not saving the princess. He is taking down the bad guy because Link just has to. B-t takes the same approach by making Banjo and Kazooie go on an adventure to thwart evil, because they realize they just have to.The gameplay is a very big improvement from B-K. During B-t you will find little golden musical notes. I don’t want to go into too much detail as far as musical notes go, but essentially you collect them, show them to a mole, an army mole…….. I guess. And he teaches you new skill. Some of them are mandatory to learn like learning how to shoot different types of eggs. While some of the other ones you learn, like the breegull bash (a move that allows you to take kazooie out of your backpack and hit her against the ground) and is only there for the players amusement, and trust me, it is amusing. But my favorite gameplay upgrade is the ability to aim where you shoot your eggs. Kazooie has always had an ability to shoot eggs from her mouth or behind. But now she is able to look around and and aim her eggs more adequately. With the new aiming system many different possibilities are opened up for the game.Besides the musical notes and aiming eggs there is two more new gameplay mechanics to the game. Wumba is a character that does what Mumbo did in the first game. She has the ability to transform you into a different forms for that specific level. She is a fun character, and the individual transformations are creative comical, to say the least. Mumbo a shaman that was in B-K is now a playable character. And I’m gonna be honest here, he pretty much stinks. His biggest purpose is to help power up things so that they can be accessible, for Banjo and Kazooie. For example in a level called Witchy-World you use mumbo to power up a bumper cars arena.  When you are just running around as him though, he doesn’t have much to offer. He has a stick that he uses to paralyse the enemy for a short amount of time before he defeats them. And that is is, a short stick, really short, you have to be really close to an enemy for the attack to land any damage. At least he looks cool.The world is much bigger in this game",D-gibbls

Very close behind is Yooka-Laylee, which also manages to defeat the original game in style and charm. I will say that the game is very dark and should've been rated E +10 if that rating existed back then- the game has witchcraft and animated violence (duh), one of the bosses spews a small amount of blood when hit, and the said boss' name is very close to a swear word. I said all that to say this: Thanks Rare. Thanks for such a wonderful adventure that I've been playing for nine years as of 2018- only wish I could've sooner.",Samuel-Kazooie

Ooh how naive I was. This is easily not only the worse Starfox I have ever played, but also the worse N64 shooter that I have played as well. Honestly, I am still in shock over how absolutely awful this game turned out to be.You see, the worse thing about this game is all of the hype and praise that surrounds it. You get the impression that not only is this a fantastic N64 game, but one of the best! At first, it is a very good game. However, once you get into it, you realize how this is a video game that is clearly a victim of genuinely terrible game design. Everything is way too easy at first, it's dead obvious. So how did the game designers fix this? You would be right to think that they simply made it more challenging later on, but sadly this is not true. The route that the designers chose to make this game more challenging was to simply make it cheap, and cheap as hell. That's right, you will not lose due to your own skill, no, if you lose, it will be due to some poor and/or cheap design choice. To top it all off, the final boss is nothing but a giant, detached, floating monkey head with giant, detached, floating hands. I think that pretty well explains the story for this game as well.With the 3DS coming out soon, and a 3DS version announced, I got this game to see what the hype is all about.

Gameplay 9/10- addictive, and stimulating, so much is happening on screen at once, enemy variety certainly helps and even though some may be disappointed with the generic cookie-cutter enemies that die with one shot and lack of difficulty. Choosing multiple paths and two different endings give it much replay ability value. Boss fights are fought in either a sandbox or POV fashion. They are generally easy and not too challenging, though there are some exceptions. Minus the sandbox levels, each stage ends with a boss battle.

It may not seem like a huge deal, but Super Mario 64 did the same thing with showingStar Fox is one of the most popular games on the N64, and for good reason too; it brought new ideas to the video gaming board.

It may not seem like a huge deal, but Super Mario 64 did the same thing with showing the possibilities of a 3D game, and it was one of the greatest games made.The keyword to this whole situation is ""Master"". For a game to be good, you have to expand and evaluate on the ideas and concepts on a game. To master a game, you have to do that, plus achieve every subconscious way to attract the player. Star Fox did this, and quite well at that. It put its new mechanics to the test, not with gimmicks, but with trivial or optional situations. It found a way to have mini-obstacles in the game for the player to experiment with, like random hoops or enemy formations. It also excelled in the combat system as well. It accomplished great control-ability, and smooth movement which gave the player a feel of complete control, especially with moves like the famous ""Barrel roll"".The main thing that makes Star Fox so great is that it's hard to find anything wrong with the game. Though, there are the cheesy lines and acting, the over-easy levels at times, and the lack of cooperation with teammates, those problems are minor. You have to look at the game as a whole, and look at what appealed to you the most. In Star Fox 64, there is much to appeal to you, and you will most definitely come back to play again (Most likely to find out how to play on those other planets).",Muscularmouse

You WILL pray to get an extra life, specially after level 3, where you´ll die time after time, both cheap and honest, difficult demises. What I mean is that this game is punishing, so much that many cannot beat it without cheats even today.  Fans of Metroid Prime should definitely play it though, as T2 has a lot of basework for the ""action adventure"" that would develop later on the gamecube. It will also push the n64 to it´s limits, so be warned that IF your console is not in top shape, the jumper/expansion pack may overheat and Reset the game (for real, look it up. It´s a common problem). In the end, this game is proof of why oldschool gamers look at ""Halo-generation"" gamers with disdain.

183566,Turok 2: Seeds of Evil,Nintendo64,5," The main problem is the horrible gameplay.

183568,Turok 2: Seeds of Evil,Nintendo64,8," This watered down the Turok experience into a standard FPS-adventure game, which was even worse on the limited hardware of the N64 (this was a problem whenever people tried to make a 'regular' game or port for it).

The music was nice to listen to and I would say it is some of the best for the N64 out of all the games. The controls are very tight and responsive, the learning curve here is minimal, but they do feel copy and paste for every vehicle. The tracks are quite varied and creative, with 24 tracks spread across 4 cups and an unlockable X cup (random track generator), making for great replay value. The difficulty is quite high, but very rewarding with many unlockable drivers - 30 in all. Single player also featured practice, time attack, and a really neat death race mode, where you have to take out all the other drivers as fast as you can. Multiplayer supports 4 players with no frame rate drop or weird limitation to speak of. There are also some customization options available for this mode. If you also count the disk drive expansion, you also get a track and ship creator as well as new ships for some of the characters. There were a few downsides to speak of, though. The graphics and detail in everything was downgraded, the AI at times can be pretty unfair (although not impossible to beat), the frame rate did suffer just a tad when the race got congested, and bumping into walls and other drivers caused me to slide, which was pretty annoying.Those aside, the game has a lot of longevity and fun, handles well, and has an amazing sense of speed. As a fan of racing games, I consider F-Zero X as the best racing game for the N64, just beating out San Francisco Rush 2049 by about a third of a Falcon Punch lol.

It was the first FPS I owned on the Nintendo 64, and I just loved it.

I definitely logged more hours with this game than any other, even after Goldeneye came around a few months later, this was still my favorite FPS on the N64. But just because I'm having a blast of nostalgia doesn't mean that everything I have to say about this game is necessarily a good thing. Its one of the best games on the Nintendo 64, but it still has its flaws. Some very obvious, others not so significant. First off, Turok... is hard. It has a very fair difficulty curve, but the majority of the game requires the player to wander aimlessly through a landscape that usually has a whole jumble of paths that lead to areas very far away, often leading to nowhere important or the player comes to find out that they cannot proceed without having pressed a button or switch somewhere else. Each level contains multiple artifacts that the player must collect in order to access other maps, which means that there are many different locations the player must go through to get them, and they will most likely have to play the level again multiple times in order to get the rest. Every time a level is restarted, all enemies, puzzles, doors, and items are reset. So you have to kill everything ALL OVER again, hit all the buttons ALL OVER again, etc. It can be very tedious at times, especially if one gets lost, which is guaranteed to happen many, many times. Getting lost in Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is extremely frustrating due to the extreme case of multiple-path syndrome that Turok is notorious for, and can also be very deadly: Every enemy you kill re-spawns a short time later. Meaning, you can never actually kill an enemy permanently, regardless if you leave the level or not. They just keep coming and coming. If you get lost, and end up in areas you've already been, there's a very good chance everything you just killed in that room is back again, ready to blow you away just as it did the last 5 or 6 times you passed through. The first few times you play Turok, it's can be daunting. But once you get the game nailed down, it's very enjoyable. It has very good length and and lots of re-playability.

Also the AI does try to balance the game by increasing fumbles and interceptions to give the losing player a leg up, which can be frustrating for seasoned players, especially when you get back to back fumbles and interceptions against you.

This RPG has pretty good amount of depth to it, and while you can manage without it, you'll probably find yourself frequently referencing online guides to understand the intricacies of the game mechanics (alignments, evolution sequences, special characters, etc.) The story is very interesting and well done, drawing you into a fascinating world of ever-increasing wonder and danger. There are numerous difficult decisions to make, and while the storyline is generally linear, you often do have multiple options for which location to visit next--sometimes with important ramifications. The game is fairly lengthy, which I consider a good thing, but it means that if you take a long break from it you might have difficulty remembering what's happened.

Basically, what I mean is that the proffesional reviews of this game mean nothing. Since it is a game from Rare they have tried to pick out every little thing possible because Rare is held to very high standards (unfairly in some cases, such as here). If this was a game from any other developer, its reviews would have been considerably better. With that being said, this game is an amazing fast paced little fireball of a fun thing. One of the biggest pluses that I think it gets bashed for is the difficulty. Unless you're a wimpy, whiney little newbie gamer who can't handle tough stuff, you should revel in the fact that this game is pretty difficult. At times, it's repetitive trying to capture all the tribals and certain other goals, but nothing so overwhelming that you will have to stop playing.

The game is fantastic in my opinion you will play games like Uncharted, Last of us or Gears of War and they all have a similar feel to it. BUT Jet Force Gemini is a unique game it is a third person shooter space exploration odyssey. The only minor thing I dislike is the tribal collection, games during this era had a lot of collection like jack and daxter had the precursor collecting. Anyway if you want a unique game that will revitalize you interest in gaming play Jet Force Gemini you will not regret it. But it is not for the faint of heart as it will require you to read walk-through. Nonetheless it is a very rewarding game. I could not beat it during my childhood but once I reached adulthood I beat it in a snap! The most fun I had with this game is going to other worlds and seeing the different planets. The game has a variety of colors ranging from dark moody and dull to bright and colorful environments. The music in this game is also very good. The reason is because the music matches the environment. If you are in a creepy spooky place the music will sound dark and spooky. However if you are in a place that is cheery and bright the music will reinvigorate you and bring you up to speed. The game is not too difficult in my opinion the bosses just require that you keep preserving and eventually you will beat it. I would not say that this game is as hard as demons souls or dark souls. It is a bit easier than that but do not let your guard down as the enemies are no pushovers. In the end the game does a lot of things right but as I mentioned before the tribal collection can be a bit repetitive. I always felt that the tribal exploration was always one of the biggest weakness of jet force Gemini but now I realize it is probably one of its strongest. For example, once you are looking for tribals you will actually look at the map more closely and admire the architecture and landscapes of the games. I think one of the main problems with gaming now is that modern gaming does not let you explore or absorb your environment it keeps rushing you to the next level. But Jet Force Gemini encourages you to explore and digest you environment. After over 15 years I am proud to say that I joined the proud hero's who have beat Jet Force Gemini.",Kinghenry8
